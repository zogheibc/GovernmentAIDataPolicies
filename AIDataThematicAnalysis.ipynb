generative AI (Canada.ca)      Federal       Guide https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html 2025-08-22T14:14:27+00:00       en      51820       7991 Guide on the use of generative artificial intelligence\\nOn this page\\nOverview\\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) tools offer many potential benefits to Government of Canada (GC) institutions. Federal institutions should explore potential uses of generative AI tools for supporting and improving their operations, but they should not use these tools in all cases. Institutions must be cautious and evaluate the risks before they start using them. They should also limit the use of these tools to instances where they can manage the risks effectively.\\nThis document provides guidance to federal institutions on their use of generative AI tools. This includes instances where federal institutions are deploying these tools. It provides an overview of generative AI, identifies challenges relating to its use, puts forward principles for using it responsibly, and offers policy considerations and best practices.\\nThis guide also seeks to raise awareness and foster coordination among federal institutions. It highlights the importance of engaging key stakeholders before deploying generative AI tools for public use and before using them for purposes such as service delivery.\\nStakeholders include:\\n- legal counsel\\n- privacy and security experts\\n- the Office of the Chief Information Officer at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS)\\n- bargaining agents\\n- advisory groups\\n- clients of GC services\\nThe guide complements and supports compliance with many existing federal laws and policies, including those in the areas of privacy, security, intellectual property, and human rights.\\nThis second version of the guide incorporates feedback from internal stakeholders and external experts.\\nIt will be updated regularly to keep pace with regulatory and technological change.\\nTo support public servants considering the use of these tools in their daily work, a concise summary of this guide offering do’s and don’ts is also available.\\nWhat is generative AI?\\nThe Directive on Automated Decision-Making defines AI as information technology that performs tasks that would ordinarily require biological brainpower to accomplish, such as making sense of spoken language, learning behaviours or solving problems.\\nGenerative AI is a type of AI that produces content such as text, audio, code, videos and images. Footnote 1 This content is produced based on information the user inputs, called a “prompt,” which is typically a short instructional text.\\nExamples of generative AI tools:\\n- large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot and LLaMA\\n- GitHub Copilot and FauxPilot, which produce code based on text prompts\\n- DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, which produce images from text or image prompts\\nThese examples include both proprietary and open-source models. Both types have their own benefits and drawbacks in terms of cost, performance, scalability, security, transparency and user support.\\nIn addition, generative AI models can be fine-tuned, or custom models can be trained and deployed to meet an organization’s needs. Footnote 2\\nMany generative AI models have been trained on large volumes of data, including publicly accessible data from the Internet. Based on the training data, these models generate content that is statistically likely in response to a prompt, Footnote 3 for example, by predicting the next word in a sentence. Techniques such as human supervision and reinforcement learning can also be applied to further improve the outputs, Footnote 3 and users can provide feedback or modify their prompt to refine the response. Generative AI can therefore produce content that looks as though a human produced it.\\nGenerative AI can be used to perform or support tasks such as:\\n- writing and editing documents and emails\\n- generating images for presentations\\n- coding tasks, such as debugging and generating templates and common solutions\\n- summarizing information\\n- brainstorming\\n- research, translation and learning\\n- providing support to clients (for example, answering questions, troubleshooting)\\nChallenges and opportunities\\nBefore federal institutions start using generative AI tools, they must assess and mitigate certain ethical, legal and other risks. For example, these tools can generate inaccurate content; amplify biases; and violate intellectual property, privacy and other laws. Further, some tools may not meet federal privacy and security requirements. When institutions use these tools, they must protect personal information and sensitive data. As well, because these tools generate content that can look as though a human produced it, people might not be able to tell whether they are interacting with a person or a tool. The use of these tools can also affect the skill and judgment of public servants and can have environmental costs. The development and quality assurance practices of some generative AI models have also been associated with socio‑economic harms such as exploitative labour practices. Footnote 4 For example, data‑labelling or annotation requires extensive manual input, and this work is often outsourced to countries where workers are paid very low wages. Footnote 5\\nGenerative AI tools rely on models that pose various challenges, including limited transparency and explainability. They also rely on training data that is difficult to access and assess. These challenges stem in part from large model sizes, high volumes of training data, and the proprietary nature of many tools. In addition, the outputs of the models are constrained by the prompts users enter and by the training data, which may lack context that is not publicly accessible on the Internet.\\nTraining data could also be outdated. For example, ChatGPT-3.5 is trained on data up to early 2022, so it has a limited ability to provide information on events or developments after that. Footnote 6 Footnote 7 Training data can also be biased and lack a diversity of views, given that the Internet is frequently the data source. These biases can then be reflected in the outputs of the tools.\\nThe performance of these tools can also vary from language to language. Models in English and other languages that are well represented in the training data often perform better than models in languages that are less well represented. Footnote 8 As well, these tools have limitations that reduce their utility for certain purposes; for example, they tend to perform inconsistently on tasks related to emotional or nuanced language. Footnote 9 Footnote 10\\nGenerative AI could also pose risks to the integrity and security of federal institutions, given its potential misuse by threat actors. Federal institutions should be aware of these risks and consider the best practices recommended by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security in their guidance Generative Artificial intelligence (AI) - ITSAP.00.041.\\nAlthough these tools present challenges and concerns, they also offer potential benefits to public servants and federal institutions. For example, they can enhance productivity through increased efficiency and quality of outputs in analytical and writing tasks in several domains. Footnote 11 Footnote 12 More analysis is needed to determine the most appropriate and beneficial uses of these tools by federal institutions. Experimentation, coupled with performance measurement and analysis, is needed to better understand potential gains and trade-offs and to inform the government’s approach to the use of these tools.\\nRecommended approach\\nIn this section\\nFederal institutions should explore how they could use generative AI tools to support their operations and improve outcomes for Canadians. Given the challenges and concerns relating to these tools, institutions should assess and mitigate risks and use them only for activities where they can manage the risks effectively. With the growing adoption of these technologies in different sectors and by the public, exploration by federal institutions will help the government understand the risks and opportunities of these tools and keep pace with the evolving digital landscape.\\nThe risks of using these tools depend on what they will be used for and on what mitigation measures are in place.\\nExamples of low‑risk uses:\\n- writing an email to invite colleagues to a team‑building event\\n- editing a draft document that will go through additional reviews and approvals\\nExamples of higher‑risk uses (such as uses in service delivery):\\n- deploying a tool (for example, a chatbot) for use by the public\\n- generating a summary of client information\\nFederal institutions should experiment with low-risk uses before they consider higher‑risk uses. They should always tailor best practices and risk‑mitigation measures to each use.\\nWhen deciding whether to use generative AI tools, public servants should refer to the guide to ethical decision-making (section 6 of Values Alive: A Discussion Guide to the “Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector”).\\nTo maintain public trust and ensure the responsible use of generative AI tools by federal institutions, institutions should align with the “FASTER” principles that TBS has developed:\\n- Fair: ensure that content from these tools does not include or amplify biases and that it complies with human rights, accessibility, and procedural and substantive fairness obligations; engage with affected stakeholders before deployment\\n- Accountable: take responsibility for the content generated by these tools and the impacts of their use. This includes making sure generated content is accurate, legal, ethical, and compliant with the terms of use; establish monitoring and oversight mechanisms\\n- Secure: ensure that the infrastructure and tools are appropriate for the security classification of the information and that privacy and personal information are protected; assess and manage cyber security risks and robustness when deploying a system\\n- Transparent: identify content that has been produced using generative AI; notify users that they are interacting with an AI tool; provide information on institutional policies, appropriate use, training data and the model when deploying these tools; document decisions and be able to provide explanations if tools are used to support decision-making\\n- Educated: learn about the strengths, limitations and responsible use of the tools; learn how to create effective prompts and to identify potential weaknesses in the outputs\\n- Relevant: make sure the use of generative AI tools supports user and organizational needs and contributes to better outcomes for clients; consider the environmental impacts when choosing to use a tool; identify appropriate tools for the task; AI tools aren’t the best choice in every situation\\nFor assistance in determining the appropriate use of these tools, public servants should consult relevant stakeholders such as:\\n- their institution’s legal services, privacy and security experts\\n- the offices of the chief information officer and chief data officer for their institution\\n- their institution’s diversity and inclusion specialists\\nThe following can also provide support:\\n- the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security\\n- Statistics Canada\\n- the Office of the Chief Information Officer of Canada (part of TBS)\\nResponsibilities for federal institutions\\nFederal institutions should evaluate generative AI tools for their potential to help employees, not replace them. Institutions are encouraged to responsibly explore uses and to enable employees to optimize their work while ensuring that all uses of these tools are ethical, align with the FASTER principles and comply with policies and laws.\\nIn evaluating these tools and exploring how they could use them, institutions have a number of responsibilities including:\\n- ensuring that employees can access and take training on the effective and responsible use of generative AI tools\\n- supporting employees in improving their knowledge of topics such as detecting biased and inaccurate content\\n- providing access to secure generative AI tools that meet government information, privacy and security requirements\\n- enabling access to online generative AI tools, in alignment with the Policy on Service and Digital (requirement 4.4.2.5) and the Directive on Service and Digital Appendix A: Examples of Acceptable Network and Device Use (Non-Exhaustive List)\\n- implementing oversight and performance management processes to monitor the impacts of these tools and to make sure both the tools themselves and their uses comply with applicable laws and policies and align with the FASTER principles, particularly during deployment\\n- engaging with employees to understand their needs\\n- consulting with stakeholders such as end-users, client representative groups and bargaining agents before high-risk deployments\\nInstitutions should have effective change management practices so that they can help employees improve their current skills and develop new ones.\\nManagers need to understand what these tools can and can’t be used for and should have realistic expectations of how the tools might help improve employees’ productivity.\\nInstitutions should also evaluate the risks and opportunities associated with using these tools and develop guidance for their institution that aligns with this guide and is tailored to their organization’s context and needs.\\nPolicy considerations and best practices\\nIn this section\\nDoes the Directive on Automated Decision-Making apply?\\nThe Directive on Automated Decision-Making applies to automated systems that are used to support or make administrative decisions, including systems that rely on AI. Like other AI systems, generative AI systems have capabilities that allow them to make assessments or determinations about clients as part of the service delivery process. For example, a generative AI system could be used to summarize a client’s data or to determine whether they are eligible for a service. Footnote 13 These administrative uses can affect how an officer views and decides on a case, which has implications for the client’s rights, interests and privileges.\\nThe directive applies to generative AI systems when they are used to make or inform administrative decisions. Institutions must make sure they meet the requirements of the directive, which include completing the Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) and other requirements that support transparency, quality assurance and procedural fairness.\\nHowever, generative AI may not be suited for use in administrative decision-making. The design and function of generative models can limit institutions’ ability to ensure transparency, accountability and fairness in decisions made by these systems or informed by their outputs. As well, the terms of use for the generative AI products of many technology companies prohibit using their products to make high-impact decisions. For example, OpenAI does not allow the use of their models for decisions about health conditions, credit, employment, educational institutions, or public assistance services; law enforcement and criminal justice; and migration and asylum. Footnote 14 Similarly, Google prohibits use of their generative AI services from making “automated decisions in domains that affect material or individual rights or well-being.” Footnote 15 These limitations underscore the importance of complying with the directive’s requirement to consult legal services during the design phase of an automation project. This requirement helps make sure federal institutions understand the legal risks of administrative uses of generative AI systems both for themselves and for their clients.\\nNot all uses of generative AI are subject to the directive. For example, using generative AI tools in research or to brainstorm, plan, or draft routine correspondence falls outside the scope of the directive. However, such non-administrative uses are still subject to the laws and policies that govern federal institutions.\\nPrivacy considerations\\nAll personal information handled by federal institutions is subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act and related policy instruments. Personal information is defined as information about an identifiable individual that is recorded in any form. The act and the privacy policy suite include requirements for when and how personal information is collected, created, used or disclosed using a generative AI system.\\nThe privacy risks will depend on how the generative AI system is used, how it processes information about individuals, and whether it is publicly accessible online or is deployed on the government’s secure network.\\nPublic servants must not input personal information into publicly available online generative AI tools. Doing so would constitute an unlawful disclosure of the information because the supplier might store a copy of the information. Public servants may, however, input personal information into generative AI systems that are controlled or configured by the government when the appropriate privacy and security controls are in place. When using a generative AI tool controlled by the institution, employees are responsible for following all privacy and protection of personal information requirements as they are for any other system.\\nIf the output of a generative AI tool results in the creation of new personal information, the institution must manage the new information according to privacy requirements. For example, if an institution deploys a generative AI tool on its network to assist in assessing risk, the risk level attributed to individual applications would constitute personal information. As another example, a summary of an application for a service or benefit produced by a generative AI tool could constitute new personal information. In both of these examples, the risk level and the summary would require the appropriate privacy protections and be subject to other requirements for handling personal information.\\nWhen institutions are considering procuring, developing or deploying a generative AI tool, privacy officials must be consulted to determine whether a Privacy Impact Assessment is needed to identify and mitigate privacy risks ahead of deployment. When institutions are building IT solutions that use generative AI, they must make sure they meet privacy requirements. The Digital Privacy Playbook contains more information on these requirements and on how to incorporate privacy guidance into IT solutions that use generative AI.\\nDe-identification and the use of synthetic data can help institutions reduce the impact and likelihood of privacy breaches when developing, training, using and evaluating the outputs of generative AI tools. Privacy Implementation Notice 2023‑01: De-identification contains more information about these privacy preserving techniques. Other safeguards such as administrative controls, access rights, and auditing are also important to reduce the risk of inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized access, re‑identification or inference, and to generally preserve the privacy of individuals.\\nDocumentation requirements\\nUnder the Directive on Service and Digital, GC employees are responsible for documenting their activities and decisions of business value. For example, records of decisions to develop or deploy a generative AI tool and steps taken to ensure that the tool produces appropriate and accurate outputs; and when the generative AI tool is used in a way that would trigger the Directive on Automated Decision Making. Appendix E (Identifying and Recognizing Information and Data of Business Value) of the Guideline on Service and Digital can assist institutional officials with this process. Library and Archives Canada’s Generic Valuation Tools (GVT) may also be helpful when they cover a business activity within the scope of which generative AI is used.\\nThe context in which generative AI is used must be considered when evaluating the relative business value of the associated information and data. The business value will inform documentation requirements. For example, the use of generative AI tools to assist with daily tasks such as the following is more likely to yield transitory information:\\n- drafting emails or documents\\n- generating images or assisting in creating presentations\\n- supporting coding activities by computer programmers\\n- brainstorming ideas or research information\\n- translating text between languages\\nUnder the Directive on Service and Digital, the institutional chief information officer, in collaboration with other institutional officials, as necessary, is responsible for the open and strategic management of information and data and for documenting corresponding institutional information and data life cycle management practices. The Guideline for Employees of the Government of Canada: Information Management (IM) Basics, Guidance on Data Quality and Guidance on Metadata Life Cycle Management offer related guidance and best practices.\\nWhen institutions deploy generative AI tools to support or make administrative decisions, additional documentation requirements related to transparency, quality assurance and reporting apply. These requirements are set out in subsections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.5 of the Directive on Automated Decision-Making.\\nAll documentation surrounding the use, development and deployment of generative AI systems under the control of a government institution is subject to the Access to Information Act and the Library and Archives of Canada Act and must be retained and disposed of accordingly.\\nPotential issues and best practices\\nThis section provides an overview of several areas of risk and sets out best practices for the responsible use of generative AI in federal institutions. In addition to the best practices for users of generative AI in the federal government, there are best practices specific to federal institutions that develop or deploy these tools to ensure that risks are appropriately assessed and mitigated, and to distinguish between the responsibilities of users and developers. Not all best practices apply in every situation, so federal institutions are encouraged to tailor their approach to each use.\\na. Protection of information\\nIssue: some generative AI tools do not meet government information security requirements\\nThe protection of personal, classified, protected and proprietary information is critical when using generative AI systems. The suppliers of some generative AI tools may inspect input data or use it to further train their models, which could result in privacy and security breaches. Risks can also arise from input data being stored on servers not controlled by the GC, where data might be retained for longer than necessary, made accessible, further distributed, or vulnerable to a data breach. Footnote 16 Some tools, public or otherwise, may not meet the privacy and security requirements set out in federal law and policy. Developing or deploying generative AI systems on institutions’ secure networks may mitigate some risks, and institutions should seek approval from their internal officials, such as their chief security officer, designated official for cyber security and chief information officer. As part of these approvals, a formal risk assessment and acceptance is recommended because additional mitigation measures may be needed to lower risks to an acceptable level.\\nBest practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions\\n- Don’t enter sensitive or personal information into any tools not managed by the GC.\\n- Don’t submit queries on non-GC managed tools that could undermine public trust if they were disclosed. See Appendix B of the Directive on Service and Digital for examples of unacceptable network and device uses.\\n- Understand how a system uses input data (for example, whether it’s used as training data and whether it’s accessible to suppliers).\\n- Ask legal services, the institutional chief security officer, and the privacy team to review a supplier’s terms of use, privacy policy and other legal documents before using any system to process sensitive or proprietary information.\\n- Use infrastructure and tools that are appropriate for the security classification of the information, in accordance with the Directive on Security Management.\\n- Seek the approval of the institutional chief security officer before using, procuring or deploying generative AI for protected or other sensitive information.\\n- Consider the requirements for information and data residency in the Directive on Service and Digital and related guidance in the Guideline on Service and Digital.\\n- Use the “opt-out” feature, where possible, to ensure that prompts are not used to train or further develop an AI system.\\nAdditional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool\\n- Conduct regular system testing before and during the operation of a system to ensure that risks of potential adverse impacts, as well as risks associated with inappropriate or malicious use of the system, are identified and mitigated.\\n- Apply more in-depth testing methods to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in instances where systems will be made publicly available. This should include penetration testing, adversarial testing or red teaming.\\n- Plan independent audits for assessing generative AI systems against risk and impact frameworks. Leverage existing risk management frameworks, when appropriate. See the guidance on the Risk management page.\\n- Develop a plan to document and respond to cyber security events and incidents, aligned with the Government of Canada Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP). Update the plan as needed to address the evolving threat environment.\\n- Consider best practices such as the National Cyber Security Centre’s Guidelines for Secure AI System Development and the National Security Agency’s Deploying AI Systems Securely.\\nb. Bias\\nIssue: generated content may amplify biases or other harmful ideas that are dominant in the training data\\nGenerative AI tools can produce content that is discriminatory or not representative, or that includes biases or stereotypes (for example, biases relating to multiple and intersecting identity factors such as gender, race and ethnicity). Footnote 17 Footnote 18 Footnote 19 Many generative models are trained on large amounts of data from the Internet, which is often the source of these biases. For example, training data is likely to reflect predominant historical biases and may not include perspectives that are less prevalent in the data or that have emerged since the model was trained. Footnote 17 Other sources that may contribute to biased content include data filtering, which can amplify the biases in the original training set, Footnote 20 framing of the prompt, Footnote 21 and model bias. Widespread use of these technologies could amplify or reinforce these biases and dominant viewpoints, and lead to less diversity in ideas, perspectives and language, Footnote 17 Footnote 22 as well as potential harms.\\nBest practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions\\n- Learn about bias, diversity, inclusion, anti-racism, and values and ethics to improve your ability to identify biased, non-inclusive or discriminatory content.\\n- Review generated content to make sure it aligns with GC commitments, values and ethics, and meets legal obligations. This review includes assessing for biases and stereotypical associations.\\n- Formulate prompts to generate content that provides holistic perspectives and minimizes biases.\\n- Strive to understand the data that was used to train the tool, for example, where it came from, what it includes, and how it was selected and prepared.\\n- Clearly indicate when content has been produced by generative AI.\\nAdditional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool\\n- Consider potential biases and approaches to mitigating them from the planning and design stage, including using gender-based analysis plus (GBA Plus) to understand how deploying a generative AI tool might impact different population groups. Don’t deploy the tool if you can’t manage the risk of biased outputs.\\n- Consult GBA Plus experts in your organization and consult people who would be directly impacted by the deployment of the tool (such as clients) in the planning and design stages, as well as in the evaluation and auditing stages, to identify impacts of the use of these tools on different population groups and to develop measures to address any negative impacts.\\n- Test for biases in the data, model and outputs before deploying a tool, and on an ongoing basis.\\n- Regularly monitor the system for adverse impacts after deployment.\\n- Reflect population diversity when deploying virtual assistants, for example, by varying the gender of the assistant.\\nc. Quality\\nIssue: generated content may be inaccurate, incoherent or incomplete\\nGenerative AI technologies can produce content that appears to be well developed, credible and reasonable but that is in fact inaccurate, nonsensical or inconsistent with source data. Footnote 23 Footnote 6 This content is sometimes referred to as a “hallucination.” Also, content generated by AI tools may not provide a holistic view of an issue. Instead, it may focus on prevalent perspectives in the training data. Footnote 17 Content might be out of date, depending on the time period the training data covers and whether the system has live access to recent data. There may also be differences in the quality of the outputs in English and French, depending on the model, task and prompt. The output quality in each language should be evaluated to ensure compliance with official language requirements.\\nThe risks associated with inaccurate content will vary depending on the context and should be assessed. For example, using generative AI tools to learn about a topic may produce incorrect information or non‑existent sources. Footnote 24 If the results were to be used in decision-making, they could lead to unfair treatment of some people or to misguided policy. As well, when considering the use of these tools in public‑facing communications, it is critical that the government not share inaccurate information, which would contribute to misinformation and erode public trust.\\nBest practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions\\n- Clearly indicate that you have used generative AI to develop content.\\n- Don’t consider generated content as authoritative. Review it for factual and contextual accuracy by, for example, checking it against information from trusted sources or by having a colleague with expertise review the response.\\n- Verify personal information created using generative AI to make sure it is accurate, up to date and complete.\\n- Assess the impact of inaccurate outputs. Don’t use generative AI when factual accuracy or data integrity is needed.\\n- Strive to understand the quality and source of training data.\\n- Consider your ability to identify inaccurate content before you use generative AI. If you can’t confirm the quality of the content, don’t use it.\\n- Learn how to create effective prompts and provide feedback to refine outputs to minimize the generation of inaccurate content.\\n- Don’t use generative AI tools as search engines unless sources are provided so that you can verify the content.\\nAdditional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool\\n- Test performance and robustness across a variety of uses before deployment. This includes making sure the quality of tools and outputs meets official languages requirements.\\n- Assess training data quality when refining models.\\n- Use grounding and prompt engineering so the models build responses from only the information you provide and control.\\n- Notify users that they are interacting with generative AI.\\n- When content is generated by AI, include links to authoritative sources to provide users with additional context and foster transparency.\\n- Provide information about the appropriate use of the tools, capabilities and limitations of the system, risk mitigation measures, source of training data and how models were developed.\\n- Monitor the performance of generative AI tools on an ongoing basis to understand potential impacts and make sure they are meeting performance targets. Document problems, pause deployment, and update the tool if performance levels are not being achieved.\\nd. Public servant autonomy\\nIssue: overreliance on AI could unduly interfere with judgment, stifle creativity and erode workforce capabilities\\nOverreliance on generative AI tools could interfere with individual autonomy and judgment. For example, some users may be prone to uncritically accept system recommendations or other outputs, which could be incorrect. Footnote 25 Footnote 26 Overreliance on AI systems can be a sign of automation bias, which is the tendency to favour results generated by automated systems, even in the presence of contrary information from non-automated sources. Footnote 25 As well, confirmation bias could contribute to overreliance Footnote 25 because the outputs of generative AI systems can reinforce a user’s preconceptions, especially when prompts are written in a way that reflects their assumptions and beliefs. Footnote 27 Excessive dependence on AI systems may result in a decline in critical thinking. This could limit diversity in thought, stifle creativity and innovation and lead to partial or incomplete analyses. As such, overreliance on AI may impede employees’ abilities to build and maintain the skills they need to perform tasks that are assigned to generative AI systems, which could potentially erode workforce capabilities.\\nBest practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions\\n- Consider whether you need to use generative AI to meet user and organizational needs.\\n- Consider the abilities and limits of generative AI when assigning tasks and reviewing system outputs.\\n- Build your AI literacy so that you can critically assess these tools and their outputs.\\n- Use generative AI tools as aids, not as substitutes. Do not outsource a skill that you do not understand or possess.\\n- Form your own views before seeking ideas or recommendations from AI tools.\\n- Use neutral wording when formulating prompts to minimize biased outputs.\\n- Always review content generated by AI, even if the system seems to be reliable in providing accurate responses.\\ne. Legal risks\\nIssue: generative AI poses risks to human rights, privacy, intellectual property protection, and procedural fairness\\nThe government’s use of generative AI systems poses risks to the legal rights and obligations of federal institutions and their clients. These risks arise from the data used to train AI models, the way systems process input data, and the quality of system outputs.\\nThe use of copyright-protected materials like articles, books, code, paintings or music by suppliers or federal institutions to train AI models may infringe on intellectual property rights. The use or reproduction of the outputs generated by these models could also infringe on such rights if they contain material that is identical or substantially similar to a copyright-protected work. Further, the ownership of content created by or with the help of generative AI is uncertain. Privacy rights could also be at risk because data used to train generative AI models could include unlawfully collected or used personal information, such as personal information obtained from publicly accessible online sources.\\nRisks could also arise from the opacity of generative AI models and their potential for producing inaccurate, biased or inconsistent outputs. This opacity makes it difficult to trace and understand how the AI system produces outputs, which can undermine procedural fairness in instances where a federal institution is obliged to provide clients with reasons for administrative decisions, such as decisions to deny benefits. The quality of AI outputs can also impact individuals’ legal rights. For example, biased outputs could lead to discrimination in services, potentially violating human rights.\\nThese risks extend beyond decision-making scenarios. When federal institutions use generative AI tools to help the public find information (for example, chatbots on institutional websites) or to produce public communications, there’s a risk that these tools will generate inappropriate content or misinformation that could contribute to or cause harm for which the government could be liable.\\nBest practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions\\n- Consult your institution’s legal services about the legal risks of deploying generative AI tools or using them in service delivery. The consultation could involve a review of the supplier’s terms of use, copyright policy, privacy policy and other legal documents.\\n- Comply with the Directive on Automated Decision-Making when using generative AI in administrative decision-making.\\n- Check whether system outputs are identical or substantially similar to copyright-protected material (look at the Frequently asked questions for more information on how to do this). Give proper attribution, where appropriate, or remove the problematic material to minimize the risk of intellectual property infringement.\\n- Consult designated officials on the licensing and administration of Crown copyright if you are planning to include outputs in public communications, in accordance with the Procedures for Publishing.\\n- Evaluate system outputs for factual inaccuracies, biases or harmful ideas that may conflict with GC values.\\n- Keep up to date on legal and policy developments related to AI regulation.\\nAdditional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool\\n- Verify the legality of the method used to obtain data for training AI models and make sure you have permission to use the data for this purpose.\\n- Document the data provenance and that you have authorization from the copyright owner.\\n- Where feasible, train your model using open‑source data that you have confirmed you may use in this way.\\n- Be transparent when you use generative AI. For example, notify users if they are interacting with a system rather than a human. Where relevant, include a disclaimer to minimize liability risks and increase transparency.\\nf. Distinguishing humans from machines\\nIssue: people may not know that they are interacting with an AI system, or they may wrongly assume that AI is being used\\nConversational agents or chatbots that use generative AI can produce responses that are so human‑like that it may be difficult to distinguish them from those of a real person. Footnote 28 As a result, clients may think they are interacting with a human. Similarly, clients may think an email they have received was written by a person when it was actually generated by an AI tool. On the other hand, clients might think they are interacting with an AI tool when they are actually dealing with a real person. Transparency about whether a client is interacting with a person or a chatbot is essential to ensure that the client is not misled and to maintain trust in government.\\nBest practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions\\n- Clearly communicate when and how you are using AI in interactions with the public.\\n- Inform users when text, audio or visual messages addressed to them are generated by AI.\\nAdditional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool\\n- Offer alternative non-automated means of communicating.\\n- Use watermarks to identify content that is generated by AI.\\n- Publish information about the system, such as a plain-language description of how it works, why your institution is using it and what steps were taken to ensure the quality of the outputs.\\ng. Environmental impacts\\nIssue: the development and use of generative AI systems can have significant environmental costs\\nThe development and use of generative AI systems can be a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water usage. These emissions come not only from the compute used to train and operate generative models but also from the production and transportation of servers that support AI programs. In addition, data centres are energy-intensive and consume vast quantities of water for on-site cooling and off-site electricity generation. Footnote 29 Although generative AI has the potential to help combat climate change, its use must be balanced against the need for swift and drastic action to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and avert irreversible damage to the environment. Footnote 30\\nBest practices for all users of generative AI in federal institutions\\n- Use generative AI tools hosted in net-zero or carbon-neutral data centres.\\n- Use generative AI tools only when relevant to program objectives and desired outcomes.\\n- Understand that the environmental impact of generative AI comes not only from its use but also from the training of the models and the manufacturing of the hardware components that run data centres, as well as the mining, manufacturing, assembly, transportation, and disposal of them.\\nAdditional best practices for federal institutions deploying a generative AI tool\\n- Find out whether your AI supplier has set any greenhouse-gas reduction targets. Footnote 31\\n- Conduct an environmental impact assessment as part of the proposal to develop or procure generative AI tools. Make sure any decision to procure these tools is made in accordance with the Policy on Green Procurement.\\n- Encourage developers to be transparent about sustainability by giving preference to those that clearly communicate the environmental impacts of their AI systems through reports on compliance with GHG Protocols. Footnote 32\\n- Use carbon‑awareness tools to estimate the carbon footprint of systems before training or production. Footnote 33\\nUse of this guide\\nFederal institutions are encouraged to use this guide as they continue to develop their own guidance on the use of generative AI. This guide and the community will continue to evolve.\\nAdditional support\\nInformation and guidance on specific uses of generative AI\\n- TBS’s Responsible Data and AI team (ai-ia@tbs-sct.gc.ca)\\n- Canadian Centre for Cyber Security’s guidance on Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) - ITSAP.00.041\\n- TBS’s summary guidance, Using Generative AI in Your Daily Work.\\nCourses and events\\nThe Canada School of Public Service offers different courses and events on AI, including Using Generative AI in the Government of Canada.\\nAdditional resources\\nFederal institutions can also contact the following for additional support:\\n- Communications Security Establishment (including the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security)\\n- Statistics Canada\\nFrequently asked questions\\nCan I use generative AI to draft emails or briefing notes?\\nYes. Depending on the context. If you use a generative AI tool to draft an email or briefing note, you are responsible for making sure that:\\n- the data you input into the tool doesn’t include personal, protected, classified or other sensitive information, unless you have confirmed that the tool is appropriate for the security classification of the information\\n- generated content is accurate, non-partisan, unbiased, and doesn’t violate intellectual property laws\\n- you inform management that you used a generative AI tool in the drafting process\\nCan I use generative AI to develop content for public communications (for example, web posts, social media)?\\nUse caution.\\nWhen you use generative AI to develop content, you are responsible for making sure that:\\n- the content is accurate, clear, non‑partisan and unbiased\\n- you have the necessary permissions to reproduce, adapt, translate or publish third‑party material\\n- the content complies with intellectual property laws\\n- you have informed the public of any significant use of generative AI in the production of content\\n- the outputs are trusted, given the potential reach and impact of public communications\\nCan I use generative AI for programming tasks?\\nYes, but you must consider the security classification of the code. Also, when it comes to code generation, some generative AI tools may produce content that violates the open‑source licences of the source code they were trained on. To address this issue, use tools to identify potential matches in public code repositories or limit the use of generative AI to tasks like debugging or code explanation.\\nCan I use generative AI when developing policy?\\nYes, but be mindful of the strengths and limitations of generative AI tools, and tailor the tasks you assign to them accordingly. You can use these tools to help with brainstorming during policy development, but use caution and validate the generated content if you will be using it as evidence. Don’t use generative AI tools to recommend, make or interpret policy.\\nWhen deciding on policy positions, make your own value judgments, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders and consistent with applicable laws. Be transparent and vigilant about any significant use of generative AI during the policy process, including in research and stakeholder engagement. Make sure the prompts used in such contexts don’t include any information that would pose legal or reputational risks to the government.\\nCan I use generative AI to automate assessments, recommendations or decisions about clients?\\nUse caution.\\nThe use of generative AI to make or inform decisions must comply with the Directive on Automated Decision‑Making, which seeks to ensure transparency, accountability and fairness in decisions made or informed by automated systems such as those that use generative AI.\\nIf you are considering using generative AI in administrative decision‑making, consult with stakeholders in your institution, including the following, at the planning and design stage:\\n- the legal services team\\n- the offices of the chief security officer, chief information officer and chief data officer\\n- GBA+ experts\\n- the privacy team\\nThey will help you make sure you can use generative AI for the identified purpose and will help you identify and mitigate risks.\\nAs well, make sure you:\\n- understand how the tool produces its outputs and can find the data it relied on\\n- assess outputs for factual accuracy and undue bias toward clients\\n- consider potential variation in outputs produced in response to similar prompts, which could lead to inequalities in the treatment of clients\\n- consider how you will meet transparency and explainability requirements\\nHow do I check whether system outputs are identical or substantially similar to copyright-protected material?\\nYou can check this by doing an Internet search to compare the output from the generative AI tool with already published material. The risk of copyright issues depends on what you are asking the generative AI system to do, the subject matter, and how you will use the output.\\nYou can lower the risk of a having problem by:\\n- using generative AI for tasks that have a lower likelihood of including copyright-protected information, such as editing content that you have drafted yourself as opposed to generating new content\\n- using materials where copyright issues are unlikely to be present, for example, a publicly available or paid-for stock image, rather than using generative AI\\nYour level of diligence in making sure you don’t have a copyright issue also depends on what you are asking the generative AI system to do, the subject matter, and how you will use the output. If the output will be publicly available, you must be extremely vigilant in checking that there are no copyright issues. You may want to consult your institution’s legal services to get advice tailored to your operational requirements.\\nWhat do I include when I’m notifying people that I used a generative AI system?\\nExactly what you tell people will depend on the context. Consider, for example:\\n- who the audience is\\n- how the system is being used\\n- what format the generated content is (such as text, images, or code)\\n- how much of the generative AI content was included in the final product\\nAt a minimum, tell people which system and version you used. In addition, you may want to also include the following:\\n- the purpose for using it\\n- whether and to what extent you reviewed, validated or modified the output\\nWhen you use generative AI in your work, inform your manager.\\nThe following table contains a few scenarios where you might use a generative AI tool and suggestions for information you might provide.\\nDo I need to record my use of generative AI tools?\\nIt depends. If your use of these tools is an activity of business value, you must document it. The context in which you are using the tools will inform whether documentation is needed and how long the documentation should be retained.\\nIf you are considering using these tools to make administrative decisions or related assessments, you should comply with the documentation requirements in the Directive on Automated Decision-Making.\\nIf you are using these tools for daily tasks such as brainstorming, translation or drafting and editing documents, you may not need to document their use because the information generated will likely be transitory.\\nEven if the tools produce transitory information, you should still notify your manager of any substantive use.\\nYour institution may also have guidance on what should be documented. Check with the office of the chief information officer or office of the chief data officer for your institution to find out if there is institution-specific guidance.\\nShould I use a personal or work email address to register for AI tools?\\nWhen using generative AI tools for GC business, you should use an official work email address. Using a work email address:\\n- helps ensure transparency and accountability\\n- helps ensure that decisions are properly recorded and transferred to corporate repositories, as appropriate\\nOther recommendations when registering for AI tools:\\n- Use a strong, unique password that is different from and not a variant of passwords you use on a corporate device or other service\\n- When possible, use two‑factor authentication on third‑party services\\nHow do I write effective prompts?\\nHow you ask a generative AI system to produce content affects the generated outputs.\\nWhen writing prompts, be as clear and specific as possible and provide context.\\nFor example, you can:\\n- provide background information\\n- identify the audience\\n- specify the length and tone of the desired output\\nYou can even give the tool a few examples of possible input and the corresponding output you’re seeking, and then ask it to replicate the approach for new inputs. Once you have an output, you can reply with additional prompts to help refine the initial output.\\nWhen developing prompts, consider your own views and biases and write prompts that provide holistic and unbiased outputs.\\nYou may also want to ask the system to only generate responses based on certain sources or input that you provide it. For example, you could copy information into the prompt and ask the system to generate an executive summary of it for your senior leader. Or you may want to include the content of an upcoming presentation and ask the system to create engaging introductory speaking points based on the presentation.\\nThere are many other prompting techniques that are not covered here, and best practices may vary depending on the model used.\\nExperiment with your prompts and language and take training on effective prompt techniques. The Canada School of Public Service offers learning products on AI, including Using Generative AI in the Government of Canada and Working with Artificial Intelligence Series: Writing Inclusive Prompts. Whatever prompt technique you use, follow the FASTER principles and the best practices provided in this guide.\\nPage details\\n- Date modified:\n","\n","Per-link CSVs directory:

2125 Algorithmic Impact Assessment tool\\nOn this page\\n1. Introduction\\nThe Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) is a mandatory risk assessment tool intended to support the Treasury Board’s Directive on Automated Decision-Making. The tool is a questionnaire that determines the impact level of an automated decision system. It is composed of 65 risk questions and 41 mitigation questions. Assessment scores are based on many factors, including the system’s design, algorithm, decision type, impact and data.\\nThe AIA was developed based on best practices in consultation with both internal and external stakeholders. It was developed in the open and is available to the public for sharing and reuse under an open licence.\\n2. Using and scoring the assessment\\nThis assessment is organized according to Government of Canada policy, ethical and administrative law considerations applied to the context of automated decision-making. It draws on the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s (TBS’s) consultations with public institutions, academia and civil society. The AIA is designed to help departments better understand and manage the risks associated with automated decision systems. The AIA is composed of questions to assess the areas of risk defined in Tables 1.1 to 1.6.\\nTables 1.1 to 1.6: risk areas\\nThe AIA also assesses the mitigation measures in place to manage the risks identified. These mitigation questions are organized into the categories defined in Tables 2.1 and 2.2.\\nTables 2.1 and 2.2: mitigation areas\\n2.1 Scoring\\nEach area contains one or more questions, and the responses to the questions contribute to a maximum score for the area. The value of each question is weighted based on the level of risk it introduces or mitigates in the automation project. The raw impact score measures the risks of the automation, while the mitigation score measures how the risks of automation are managed. The questions in risk areas 1 to 6 increase the raw impact score (see Table 3), and the questions in mitigation areas 7 and 8 increase the mitigation score (see Table 4).\\nThe current score is determined as follows:\\n- if the mitigation score is less than 80% of the maximum attainable mitigation score, the current score is equal to the raw impact score\\n- if the mitigation score is 80% or more than the maximum attainable mitigation score, 15% is deducted from the raw impact score to yield the current score\\n2.2 Impact levels\\nThe impacts of automating an administrative decision are classified into four levels, ranging from Level I (little impact) to Level IV (very high impact). The AIA is intended to identify risks and assess impacts in a broad range of areas, including:\\n- the rights of individuals or communities\\n- the health or well-being of individuals or communities\\n- the economic interests of individuals, entities or communities\\n- the ongoing sustainability of an ecosystem\\nImpact levels also vary based on the duration and reversibility of the decision, the context in which the system is operating, and the risk associated with the data used by the system.\\nEach impact level corresponds to a score percentage range. The level of impact assigned to an automation project depends on the range bracket in which the project’s score percentage falls (see Table 5). Impact levels determine the mitigations required under the Directive on Automated Decision-Making. Appendix C of the directive lists mitigation measures required for each of the four impact levels. The requirements are designed to be proportionate to the impact level. While the measures are intended to reduce the identified risks, their implementation does not alter the impact level assigned to a project. A project’s impact level can be changed only through the completion of a new AIA with updated information about the project. Under the directive (subsection 6.1.3), departments are required to review, approve and update their published AIAs on a scheduled basis, including following changes to system functionality or scope of use.\\n3. Instructions\\nThe AIA is available as an online questionnaire on the Open Government Portal. When the questionnaire is completed, the results provide an impact level and a link to the requirements under the directive. The detailed results page will also explain why the system was rated at a certain level. The results and the explanation can be printed or saved as a PDF.\\nThe AIA assesses automated decisions on a broad range of topics, including service recipients, business processes, data, and system design decisions. It is best to complete the AIA with a multi-disciplinary team that brings expertise in all of these areas.\\nEach question in the AIA should be answered so that the impact score can be accurate. If the answer to a question is unknown, select the lowest score option for the question. Where applicable, be prepared to provide the documentary evidence upon request.\\nSection 6 of the directive provides a comprehensive list of the requirements that departments are responsible for. Some of the requirements increase for higher-impact levels, including the type of peer review and the extent of human involvement in the decisions. For a complete list of requirements that vary with the impact level, refer to the appendix Impact Level Requirements in the directive. Other requirements are baseline requirements that do not vary according to the impact level, such as consulting with the institution’s legal services unit prior to the development of the system, testing and monitoring outcomes, and providing applicable recourse options to challenge the decisions.\\n3.1 When to complete the AIA\\nThe AIA should be completed at the beginning of the design phase of a project. The results of the AIA will guide the mitigation and consultation requirements to be met during the implementation of the automated decision system as set out in the directive.\\nThe AIA should be completed a second time, prior to the production of the system, to validate that the results accurately reflect the system that was built. The revised AIA should be published on the Open Government Portal as the final results.\\nReviewing and updating the AIA\\nThe AIA should be reviewed, approved and updated on a scheduled basis, and when the functionality or scope of the system changes (subsection 6.1.3). The schedule of review can be aligned with and informed by the monitoring requirements (subsection 6.3.2) and the reporting requirements (subsections 6.5.1 and 6.5.2).\\nRisks in automated decision-making are difficult to fully anticipate during the development of a system. Regular reviews throughout the system’s lifecycle will ensure that the AIA remains up to date and the system remains effective.\\nThe chosen frequency of review can depend on a variety of factors, including the nature of the system, the context of its deployment and the decision for which it is used.\\nFor example, the AIA may be reviewed and updated more often when:\\n- the service volumes are high\\n- the system affects a large number of clients\\n- the environment the system operates in evolves or changes rapidly\\n- the impact level of the system is a Level 3 or 4\\n3.2 What to consider when completing an AIA\\nCollect information about your project\\nA broad range of information about an automation project is required to fully answer the questions in the risk and mitigation areas of the AIA. Prior to starting the AIA, it is useful to have information about:\\n- the administrative decision that the automated decision system will inform, contribute to or make, the context in which the system will be used, and the way the system will assist or replace the judgment of a human decision maker\\n- the clients who are subject to the decision, including their demographics, needs or barriers they may encounter\\n- the potential impacts of the decision on clients, including their duration and reversibility, and how the potential impacts are identified, assessed and mitigated\\n- the algorithm, including data processing parameters and techniques, and the output\\n- the input data used by the system, including details on type, source, method of collection and security classification\\n- planned or existing quality assurance measures\\n- planned transparency measures to communicate information about the initiative to clients and the public\\n- consultation approach with federal colleagues, clients or interest groups that represent clients or other partners\\n- record of recommendations or decisions made by the system, and any log or explanation generated by the system for such a record\\n- information about how your institution manages and delivers information technology services and solutions\\nConsult your ATIP office\\nThe institutional Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) office or other delegated authority for privacy should be consulted to ensure that the privacy impacts of automated decision systems using or processing personal information, or that otherwise have an impact on individuals’ privacy rights, are identified, assessed and mitigated. Engagements can enable project leads to:\\n- determine whether the automated decision system will make use of personal information as defined in section 3 of the Privacy Act\\n- verify whether the proposed system’s use of personal information is accounted for in relevant Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) and Personal Information Banks (PIBs), and identify actions and approvals required under privacy legislation and policy\\n- determine applicable requirements in the Policy on Privacy Protection and supporting policy instruments, with the goal of ensuring that the appropriate safeguards are in place for the creation, collection and handling of personal information throughout the life cycle of the system, including plans for responsive action in the event of a privacy breach\\n- inform approaches to notifying the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada of the proposed system and any foreseeable impacts on the privacy of Canadians, as required in the Policy on Privacy Protection\\n- ensure that any personal information collected or created by or for the automation project is demonstrably necessary for the program or activity, as required by the Directive on Privacy Practices\\n- ensure that appropriate privacy protection clauses are included in contracts, agreements or arrangements with vendors or partners providing automation services, solutions or products\\n- ensure that the AIA is reviewed by privacy officials prior to its publication on the Open Government Portal, in accordance with the Directive on Open Government\\nEngage with legal services\\nThe legal services unit must be consulted to identify and address legal risks arising from the development, procurement or use of an automated decision system. Consultations should begin at the concept stage of an automation project, prior to the development or procurement of a system. The nature of legal risks significantly depends on the design of the system (for example, the training data and model), the context of deployment, and the type of administrative decision being automated. Seeking legal advice on an automated decision system can enable project leads to:\\n- comply with the directive’s requirement to consult with the legal services unit from the concept stage of a project (see subsection 6.3.12)\\n- identify potential impacts on individual rights and freedoms and develop plans to manage risks\\n- assess risks to procedural fairness based on factors, including but not limited to the explainability of system outputs, relevance of system rules and input data to an administrative decision, and availability of recourse options\\n- confirm whether the program has the requisite authorities to proceed with the proposed automation project, including any associated collection or creation of personal information (in coordination with the relevant ATIP office or other delegated authority for privacy)\\n- consider licensing issues, including with respect to trade secrets, and any constraints they may impose on a department’s ability to access and test proprietary systems (see subsection 6.2.6 of the directive)\\nEngage Gender-based Analysis Plus experts\\nEngage with the institution’s diversity and inclusion specialists while completing the AIA. They can assist with impacts and mitigation measures related to diversity, inclusion, bias and intersectionality. They can also assist in completing the Gender-based Analysis Plus analysis as required under subsection 6.3.8.\\nContact TBS’s Office of the Chief Information Officer\\nThe Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) of TBS is responsible for maintaining the AIA tool and overseeing departmental compliance with the Directive on Automated Decision-Making. The team can support departments with interpreting and answering questions in the AIA and guide them through the publication process.\\nDepartments are encouraged to contact TBS OCIO at ai-ia@tbs-sct.gc.ca for any questions regarding the directive or AIA.\\n3.3 Publishing the AIA\\nDepartments are responsible for publishing the final results of the AIA in an accessible format and in both official languages on the Open Government Portal (subsection 6.1.1). The results page of the AIA provides the option to provide translations for the text entered in the AIA. The results page also provides the option to download the results as an accessible PDF to meet this requirement. Contact your department’s Open Government team for assistance in publishing to the Open Government Portal.\\nPage details\\n- Date modified:\n","\n","Per-link CSVs directory:

### AI Strategy for the Federal Public Service 2025-2027: Full-text\\n\\nAI Strategy for the Federal Public Service 2025-2027: Full-text\\nOn this page:\\nOverview\\nIn this section:\\nWhy an AI Strategy?\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) presents unprecedented and wide-ranging opportunities to enhance the public service and the services it offers Canadians. AI can unlock capabilities beyond human limits, opening doors to new ways of working and operating. With AI, we can create new types of services to better meet the needs of those we serve and improve the quality and efficiency of services already offered.\\nAI can streamline or automate routine tasks for public servants, freeing them to focus on more complex and critical work. It can increase the public service’s efficiency, effectiveness and productivity, maximizing its value to Canadians. It can improve the speed and scale of data and information analysis far beyond what was once possible, leading to faster, more informed decision making and scientific discovery. It can also create new avenues for public engagement and help us protect Canada’s interests by enhancing our ability to protect our IT and physical infrastructure.\\nAI is not new to the Government of Canada: departments have been using it for decades. Often developed in-house, early AI applications typically served very specific purposes and were used only by specialist staff. Over the past few years, however, AI capabilities have advanced rapidly, particularly in the field of generative AI. These capabilities are now embedded in a wide range of commercial software, making them more accessible to all public servants.\\nLearn more about: AI in the Government of Canada\\nBelow are some examples of how AI is being used to improve the work of the Government of Canada.\\nCase processing: Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada’s Advanced Analytics Solutions Centre\\nThe Advanced Analytics Solutions Centre at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has been using AI-based models to triage applications for temporary and permanent residence and find those which can be automatically identified as eligible. These models have been used to accelerate the processing of more than 7 million routine cases, allowing case officers to focus on more complex cases, and to strengthen program integrity by identifying fraud patterns.\\nServing clients: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s AgPal\\nAgPal helps farmers and agri-businesses find information about over 400 federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal programs and services, along with market intelligence and research. Its generative AI tool, AgPal Chat, helps users find relevant funding and resources faster, supporting the sustainable growth and competitiveness of the sector.\\nSupporting public servants: The Public Services and Procurement Canada Human Capital Management AI Virtual Assistant\\nHuman Capital Management AI Virtual Assistant is designed to support Pay Centre compensation advisors in processing pay cases from the backlog. The assistant automates routine tasks, allowing advisors to focus on complex cases and expedite resolutions. By shifting from manual to digital processes, it enhances efficiency, reduces workload, and minimizes errors.\\nConducting research: Statistics Canada\\nStatistics Canada works with provinces and territories to collect data for the Canadian Coroner and Medical Examiner Database and organize the collected data into coherent datasets. Analysts can then assess the datasets for patterns of death over time, detecting trends to understand growing hazards to public health.\\nTranscribing and summarizing: Innovation, Science, Economic Development Canada’s (ISED) AI Accelerator\\nISED developed a tool for its Parliamentary Affairs Unit that uses AI and open data to transcribe and summarize parliamentary committee meetings. By reducing manual notetaking, it frees Parliamentary Affairs Officers to dedicate more of their skills to analysis and interpretation, improving efficiency and employee well-being by cutting down on overtime.\\nIncreasing productivity: Shared Services Canada (SSC)\\nSSC is piloting its multilingual conversational chatbot CANChat as an in-house alternative to commercial generative AI tools. CANChat can support drafting, editing, researching, summarizing, and information and data management and analysis. For greater data security and privacy, CANChat ensures that all data is safeguarded and stored in Canada, and that prompts are not used to train its AI.\\nSecuring networks: The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security’s Assemblyline tool\\nThe Assemblyline tool works to defend federal and critical infrastructure systems from cyber threats involves detecting patterns in vast quantities of data—something AI tools are ideally suited to. Since 2017, its Assemblyline tool has used machine learning to analyze malicious software, scanning over 1 billion files a year for over 300 Government of Canada and critical infrastructure organizations\\nSecuring borders: Transport Canada’s Pre-load Air Cargo Targeting (PACT) program\\nThe PACT uses AI to screen inbound air shipments before takeoff to flag those that could contain concealed explosives or other threats. The use of AI has enabled a tenfold increase in the number of shipments screened per hour and increased coverage from 6 percent to 100 percent of flights, greatly increasing safety on both passenger and cargo flights.\\nThese advances have also greatly increased the risks of AI and the challenges of managing them. They have heightened the potential for AI to overturn traditional ways of working in the public service and have increased public scrutiny of government use of AI. Beyond ethical and security concerns, challenges such as talent shortages, infrastructure gaps, technological sovereignty, and interdepartmental collaboration further complicate AI adoption. Existing and future AI systems must therefore be appropriately governed, with guidance, policy, and training in place to manage risk, address challenges, and uphold human rights, public trust, and national security. At the same time, there are real risks and opportunity costs if we fail to adapt to these new technologies.\\nThe Government of Canada needs an AI strategy to ensure that its AI adoption and use:\\n- Is aligned with the government’s values and ethics, objectives, and mandate to serve Canadians\\n- Prioritizes uses that will meet the needs of and deliver the greatest benefits to public servants and those they serve\\n- Is developed efficiently and collaboratively with internal and external partners\\n- Is responsible, safe, and secure, mitigating threats, risks, and harms to people and the environment\\nVision\\nBy responsibly adopting AI, the Government of Canada can deliver world-class services to its clients, protect our people and interests, achieve a more innovative and efficient workplace, and accelerate scientific discovery for the benefit of all.\\nPrinciples\\nHuman centred\\nWe focus on the needs of those we serve and the public servants who serve them in deciding where we adopt AI and how we integrate it into our work.\\nCollaborative\\nWe work together on AI adoption with Indigenous and Canadian partners, other Canadian and international jurisdictions, and our public service colleagues.\\nReady\\nWe have the data, infrastructure, tools, culture, talent, skills and policy we need for responsible, safe, secure, and successful AI adoption.\\nResponsible\\nWe inform clients and public servants when and how we use AI so that they trust that our use of AI respects privacy and is justified, responsible, fair, safe, and secure.\\nScope\\nMany different definitions for AI exist, including the definition in the Government of Canada’s Directive on Automated Decision-Making. One of the most widely accepted definitions comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which defines an AI system as:\\na machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.\\nAI includes:\\n- Both knowledge-based systems that use a combination of domain knowledge, rules, facts, and relationships curated by human experts and machine learning systems that that can learn from data and generalize to perform tasks without explicit instructions.\\n- Application areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, intelligent decision support systems, and intelligent robotic systems.\\nThis current strategy applies to all types of AI technologies with adaptive capabilities after initial training:\\n- At any stage of the AI lifecycle, from design, development, deployment, and operation to system decommissioning.\\n- In use for any purpose in any department or agency covered by the Policy on Service and Digital, including those used by external subcontractors. Organizations that are partially or wholly exempt from the Policy on Service and Digital, including those that fall under the national security exemption, are encouraged to comply with the AI Strategy as far as possible as a matter of good practice.\\n- Whether they are developed within the Government of Canada, open source, commercial off-the-shelf products, or custom vendor solutions.\\nThe AI Strategy excludes:\\n- Systems that only use software-based solutions without adaptive capabilities after initial training\\n- The adoption of AI by organizations outside the Government of Canada.\\nLearn more about: How we used AI in developing this Strategy\\nThe team responsible for the development of the AI Strategy used an approved generative AI tool (Microsoft Copilot) and some Microsoft Teams AI capabilities to support the work of its members.\\nAI was used during development to:\\n- Automatically transcribe some discussions\\n- Summarize and group comments and feedback\\n- Generate meeting invitation text\\n- Scan and summarize research\\n- Translate small pieces of text\\n- Draft and edit reports and discussion papers\\nAll uses of AI were consistent with TBS policy and guidance. Any personal identifiers, such as individual or organization names, were removed before AI use. Products generated by AI were reviewed by human analysts and were labelled to indicate that AI had been used in their development.\\nIn total, these uses of AI saved analysts approximately three weeks’ work during the development process, enabling the team to allow more time for engagement and consultation.\\nFor more information, please see Guide on the use of generative artificial intelligence - Canada.ca\\nForeword from the President, Chief Information Officer and Chief Data Officer\\nMessage from the President\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way Canadians interact with the Government of Canada. By using AI responsibly to modernize government operations, we can unlock new ways to increase productivity, efficiency and effectiveness, while reducing response and wait times. We can make it easier for Canadians and Canadian businesses to access all of the services, information, and opportunities the Government of Canada has to offer.\\nWhile the adoption of AI for its innovative applications is becoming the emerging norm worldwide, we must ensure its responsible use by assessing and mitigating the risks. This means addressing bias and preventing misinformation, protecting the privacy and security of Canadians, and ensuring that the benefits of AI do not come at the expense of our environment or our workforce. AI is simply a tool, not a replacement for public servants, as we look to modernize government operations to meet the needs of Canadians in the digital 21st century.\\nThe Government of Canada’s first-ever AI Strategy for the federal public service will allow us to seize the opportunities of innovative technology while establishing guardrails to protect our systems. In developing this Strategy, we engaged the public, partners and stakeholders. Participation from citizens was central to ensuring a Strategy for the public service that reflects the very democratic values we prioritize today.\\nAs we implement the Strategy across the public service, our work will continue to focus on the needs and expectations of those we serve. This means making sure Canadians are involved in the design of services that use AI. This is especially important for those who may face barriers to access, such as persons with disabilities and members of equity-deserving groups. We will also rely on the expertise of Canadian innovators and businesses that are already global leaders in AI.\\nThe AI Strategy for the federal public service establishes a robust AI governance framework to ensure the transparent and responsible use of AI. Ultimately, Canadians need to have confidence in how government uses this technology. Trust is built by being upfront and open about the use of AI, and that is central to the success of the AI Strategy.\\nTo learn more about how the Government of Canada plans to harness the potential of AI responsibly and for the benefit of all Canadians, I invite you to read the full Strategy.\\nThe Honourable Ginette Petitpas Taylor, P.C., M.P.\\nPresident of the Treasury Board\\nMessage from the Chief Information Officer and Chief Data Officer\\nWe are pleased to present the AI Strategy for the Federal Public Service 2025–2027, our plan for the responsible, secure, and accelerated adoption of AI in the public service.\\nAI is a transformative force. It can enhance the capabilities of public servants and change how we work and what we do. Adopting it in the workplace can improve our operational efficiency by automating certain repetitive manual processes and allowing employees to focus on more complex and strategic work, such as supporting decision-making and improving collaboration.\\nThe AI Strategy lays out a plan for how we move forward with AI. It highlights the importance of coordinating approaches across federal organizations, learning from our collective experiences, and supporting organizations of all sizes and maturity as they explore this technology. It sets out the role of public service leaders in adapting AI to their organizations’ mandates, ensuring strong data foundations for future AI projects, and adopting more agile practices for development and procurement.\\nThe responsible adoption of AI will require culture change within our organizations. The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat will encourage departments to give employees the time, space, support, and tools to explore its use, grow from setbacks, and collaborate with partners, both internal and external to government.\\nImplemented together with the Government of Canada’s Data Strategy, the AI Strategy will help maximize the effectiveness and value of data and AI investments across government, delivering benefits for service delivery, science and research, security, and corporate processes.\\nWe encourage all federal organizations to embrace AI responsibly to meet the expectations of all Canadians for secure and modern government operations in the digital age.\\nDominic Rochon\\nChief Information Officer of Canada\\nStephen Burt\\nChief Data Officer of Canada\\nPriority areas\\nCanada’s AI Strategy for the Federal Public Service focuses on four priority areas:\\nThese priorities were developed in collaboration with a working group of departments that have responsibilities for AI policy or implementation. They were discussed throughout our consultation with partners, stakeholders and the public and in policy consultations across the Government of Canada. They address what we heard as the most pressing needs to advance responsible adoption of AI across the Government of Canada.\\nEach of these priorities has a set of accompanying actions. These have been chosen because they are concrete, can be achieved or initiated within the AI Strategy’s two-year timeline, and have the greatest potential to advance responsible AI adoption within the public service. These actions include both ongoing and new work. Some will build on work already begun, or scale innovations and emerging best practices. Others are new actions to respond to emerging needs and known barriers that must be addressed if AI adoption is to succeed.\\nThese priorities and the associated actions reflect the time when the AI Strategy was developed. Because the future pace and direction of AI development is highly uncertain, what we and our partners, stakeholders, and clients identify as priorities may be very different at the end of the Strategy’s lifespan.\\nTo remain relevant in this rapidly changing landscape, the AI Strategy and its implementation plan will be reviewed frequently and will be renewed in 2027. Progress on implementation will be reported on a quarterly tracker. In this way we will model the agility needed for AI adoption, adapting our priorities to meet new needs while continuing to collaborate with users and engage those we serve.\\nPriority 1: Central AI capacity\\nA common theme heard from government departments during consultations was a need for a central hub to support project implementation and share knowledge. AI accelerators or specialist technical teams able to support project teams with technical development are increasingly being established within departments. However, there is an unmet need for guidance on many other aspects of AI implementation. These include identifying use cases, evaluating data readiness, assessing risk, determining whether to build or buy solutions, and navigating assessment, governance, and procurement processes. Departments also commonly expressed a need for a convenor to share knowledge, code, scalable tools, and lessons learned from departmental experience.\\nLearn more about: AI Accelerators in the Government of Canada\\nOver the past decade, more and more Government of Canada departments have established their own AI accelerators or centres of expertise to promote departmental adoption. Some examples of these include:\\nNational Research Council’s (NRC) AI Accelerator and Digital Technologies programs\\nThe NRC has promoted AI adoption across federal departments and agencies through its AI Accelerator and Digital Technologies programs, completing over 100 projects in the past five years. These initiatives span national security, digital privacy, digital health, scientific discovery, logistics, geospatial analytics, and Indigenous languages, improving public services, productivity, and situational awareness. With over 110 AI specialists and access to advanced computation facilities and global partnerships, the NRC supports and enhances AI initiatives across the Government of Canada, driving innovation and adoption for a more secure and technologically advanced nation.\\nShared Services Canada’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Program and AI Centre of Excellence (AICoE)\\nThe AI Program and the AICoE Incubate AI use cases, promote the use of AI, break down silos and foster digital innovation. Established in 2019, the AI Program has incubated more than 15 use cases, including CANChat. The AI CoE supports Government of Canada exploration of AI and intelligent automation, providing a central repository for sharing best practices, training materials, and strategic guidance. It convenes AI and intelligent automation working groups to explore challenges and identify opportunities and solutions to accelerate responsible adoption. The AI CoE also provides guidance to departments embarking on AI adoption and contributes to Algorithmic Impact Assessment peer review and the development of policy.\\nNatural Resources Canada's Digital Accelerator\\nNRCan works with scientists, economists and researchers to pilot advanced solutions and tools, including AI, strengthen digital expertise and literacy in the department and sector, and future-proof the department and its partners. Its projects include platforms or tools for accelerated materials discovery, mineral detection, industrial systems performance optimization, and grid optimization for electric vehicles.\\nKey actions\\nEstablish an AI Centre of Expertise for the Government of Canada\\nThe AI Centre of Expertise (AI CoE) will complement services offered by existing accelerators and centres, focusing on project support, knowledge sharing, and strategic guidance to support AI adoption and experimentation. It will provide project guidance, advise on common processes, and share best practice, experience, knowledge and code. It will also encourage interdepartmental or whole-of-government collaboration on solutions for common needs. The AI CoE will help business teams to:\\n- Identify high-value use cases for AI integration. This may include helping departments evaluate factors like task and data suitability; infrastructure, model, and data requirements and limitations; cost/benefit analysis; privacy, accessibility, environmental, and equity considerations; risk identification, evaluation, and mitigation; workforce impacts; and how to evaluate project success against objectives.\\n- Support data readiness: This would include supporting the implementation of the 2023-2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service as a critical enabler for AI adoption. The AI CoE could advise departments on preparing their data for AI use or training and identifying Government of Canada datasets that could be combined to enable AI.\\n- Support with procurement, governance, assessments, review processes, and other requirements. This would include providing guidance on options for procurement; algorithmic, accessibility, language, privacy, and environmental impact assessments; transparency, reporting, ethics, bias, peer review, GBA Plus analysis, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty requirements; securing AI and understanding risks; and processes for explanation and recourse. It will also include providing input into the development of a governance framework (see Priority 2) and the creation of standard language to inform vendors of their role in responsible AI adoption.\\nIn addition to supporting project teams, the AI CoE will act as:\\n- A convenor for government-wide knowledge sharing. It will share successful initiatives to prevent duplication of effort, maximize return on investment, and promote awareness and adoption of existing approved solutions. This will include sharing government-developed code and solutions, project documentation, information, policy, and instruments; soliciting feedback, use cases, and lessons learned from departments; and encouraging the scaling of successful projects. It will also work with the Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) to identify and promote training priorities and provide input into new policy or procurement vehicles.\\n- An accelerator for AI solutions to meet common Government of Canada needs. Working with departments, the AI CoE will identify potential solutions that meet government-wide needs that could be broadly scaled and support their development.\\n- A monitor of progress on AI adoption. The AI CoE will develop frameworks for progress and impact of Government of Canada AI adoption that can be used to benchmark, monitor, and report on the progress and compliance with policy and standards.\\nEnable common infrastructure\\nThe Government of Canada and departments will ensure the provision of common infrastructure to enable AI adoption and will promote the adoption of existing approved enterprise solutions. This includes:\\n- high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud infrastructure that is available, secure, and scalable to meet the demands of AI projects.\\n- common data and information management systems and practices to support sharing, scaling, and agentic capabilities across Government of Canada platforms.\\n- access to approved models, services, and application programming interfaces (APIs) within common Government of Canada cloud platforms to build or deploy systems.\\n- access to common AI solutions and capabilities in vendor solutions through a standard Government of Canada platform service.\\nWhere possible, they will support Canadian suppliers and vendors in order to promote the growth of the Canadian AI industry and ensure secure sovereign infrastructure and solutions.\\nIdentify and develop a lighthouse project\\nThis project will be either a new initiative or one currently at pilot stage that would meet an enterprise-wide need and could be readily scaled. Its development, testing, and delivery will be undertaken collaboratively by the AI CoE and lead department. It will serve as:\\n- A test case to identify barriers and project teams’ needs for support during development and obstacles to subsequent customization and scaling.\\n- A pilot for the development of government-wide governance processes (see Priority 2 ).\\n- An opportunity to develop templates and examples of project documentation.\\n- A demonstration of the value of AI use cases.\\nLearn more about: The lighthouse project\\nThe Strategy proposes the development of a lighthouse project that would both meet an enterprise-wide need and provide an opportunity to develop and test Government of Canada governance and support processes for AI adoption.\\nAs its first lighthouse project, TBS will work with the Translation Bureau at Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) to scale its self-serve language hub pilot across the Government of Canada.\\nThe Translation Bureau has developed a self-serve language hub pilot to provide PSPC employees with access to a variety of secure, real-time AI-driven language tools, trained with Canadian data. These include automated translation tools that can be used to provide instant translations of low-risk and low-value documents. The service operates in a secure cloud up to Protected B, with all data centralized within the Bureau and housed in Canada.\\nFor users, this would provide a secure and approved one-stop shop for linguistic needs. For the Government, availability of an approved automated tool would reduce translation costs without compromising data security or sovereignty or product quality. Use of the Translation Bureau’s repository of 8 billion words (2 TB) to train the model would ensure a high level of consistency, quality, and customization to the specificities of Canadian culture, identity and realities.\\nPriority 2: Policy, legislation, and governance\\nResponsible AI adoption needs clear, up-to-date legislation and policy. Together, they mark out not only the necessary guardrails for identifying and mitigating risk, but also the space within which developers are free to experiment and innovate. Clear legislation and policy help to build public trust, overcome institutional resistance to AI innovation and enable governments to move further and faster.\\nAs in many jurisdictions, some Canadian legislation and federal policy has not been revised for the AI era. Some law or policy is silent on areas needed to govern AI, while others may introduce unintended bias in data collection or obstruct AI adoption unnecessarily and unintentionally. Incremental development has created a patchwork of policies that are difficult for AI project teams to understand and navigate, and no common model for AI governance yet exists within the Government of Canada. These challenges must be addressed to build public confidence in the Government of Canada’s ability to deliver AI-enabled services.\\nLearn more about: AI-ready law and policy\\nPolicy, law, and regulations must support the use of AI and must be kept updated to ensure that they remain relevant and effective as technology evolves. In response, the Government of Canada and leading jurisdictions worldwide have begun to incorporate commitments to scheduled review cycles into key laws and policy instruments, a new best practice that should be more widely adopted.\\n- The Government of Canada’s Directive on Automated Decision-Making and associated Algorithmic Impact Assessment tool are reviewed every two years.\\n- Amendments made in 2019 to the Access to Information Act include a 5-year review cycle.\\n- The EU AI Act includes provisions for an annual review of both its list of high-risk AI systems and the AI practices it prohibits.\\nEven without a specified review cycle, other jurisdictions regularly review and amend key legislation and policy:\\n- Australia has conducted regular reviews of its Privacy Act 1988 to address emerging privacy issues and technological developments, with four major reviews since its enactment.\\n- The EU regularly reviews its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other technology-related laws to adapt to new technological advancements and challenges.\\nLastly, some jurisdictions have developed guidance to ensure that all new legislation supports new technologies by design.\\n- Denmark’s digital-ready legislation program has established mandatory assessment against seven principles for digitally-ready legislation to ensure that new laws and regulations are compatible with digital technologies and can be efficiently administered using digital tools.\\nKey actions\\nEstablish common AI governance and risk management frameworks\\nDrawing on international and Government of Canada best practice, the Government of Canada will establish common governance and risk management frameworks for the AI lifecycle to provide clear guidance to AI project teams. These frameworks will balance risk with the pace required for innovation; be scaled to system risk, sensitivity, and impact; and will be designed to adapt as technology changes. They will address potential risks associated with AI use, such as data privacy and security, bias detection and mitigation, model interpretability and explainability, environmental impact, and human involvement. The frameworks will incorporate Canadian requirements, such as the need to advance Indigenous Data Sovereignty and provide technologies in both official languages. They will also lay out the security, trust, and reliability controls necessary to ensure the continued maintenance and resilience of these systems, including system shutdown measures to respond to emergencies. This work will support ongoing efforts to harmonize data standards, increase interoperability, and support other enablers.\\nIn addition, it will include a government-wide governance structure responsible for implementing the governance framework. This will include an AI ethics review board responsible for providing guidance on responsible AI and for evaluating higher risk and impact projects at key stages of the project lifecycle. The governance structure will make use of existing Government of Canada governance bodies and organizations such as the Canada AI Safety Institute wherever possible. In addition to providing project governance, these bodies and organizations will help identify high-value AI use cases, regularly reprioritize the AI Strategy's actions, and prioritize and oversee the AI Strategy's implementation.\\nAddress policy and legislative alignment, gaps, and barriers\\nThe Government of Canada will review and propose changes to instruments that create unnecessary obstacles to AI adoption. It will fill identified policy gaps, such as clarifying the responsibilities of chief information, data and privacy officers for AI adoption, and the acceptable use of AI by outside organizations in their interactions with the Government of Canada. It will also address legal and policy ambiguities related to privacy and training data and the application of the national security exemption. The Government of Canada will update procurement policies, instruments and processes to make them more responsive to pace and requirements of AI procurement. It will also consider ways in which the Government of Canada can better align internal AI policy with the Pan Canadian AI Strategy to support the Canadian AI sector, with the United Nations Declaration Act commitments to Indigenous Data Sovereignty, and with international treaties, legislation and norms.\\nThis work will lead to the development of clear and concrete commitments to revise specific instruments within a set timeline, and an agile process to review and update policy, guidance, tools and resources to respond to technological, legislative and social change. The Government of Canada will also review the policy landscape for opportunities to synthesize or interpret existing policy to increase usability.\\nAdopt a “think AI” approach\\nThe Government of Canada will optimize its AI adoption by embedding a “think AI” approach to its policies, programs and services. The intent is not to adopt AI at all costs or in contexts where its use would not be responsible or useful. Rather, the goal is to challenge departments to identify key business problems that could be transformed using AI, consider AI options before defaulting to traditional IT or HR approaches, and make planned investments in AI and its enablers.\\nTo support this, the Government of Canada will require departments to:\\n- Identify three areas, programs or services with business problems that have a high potential to be solved using AI.\\n- Consider solutions and resourcing requirements for AI and its enablers at the outset of initiatives. This will include changes to Treasury Board submissions, Memoranda to Cabinet, and budget and off-cycle funding proposals to incorporate data, AI, compute, and other relevant requirements.\\n- Prioritize AI infrastructure and secure adoption in departmental integrated IT planning processes.\\n- Develop their own AI strategies to ensure alignment and effective use of resources.\\nPriority 3: Talent and training\\nTo adopt AI responsibly, we need people with the right technical and non-technical skills. Although Canada is a global leader in AI research, demand for AI skills significantly outpaces supply. Within the Government of Canada, there is a 30% vacancy rate for digital roles, threatening delivery and leading to a costly dependence on external contractors. As it plans for increased AI adoption, the Government of Canada must consider how it will meet its AI talent needs through training, upskilling, and recruitment so that it can optimize its use of AI to serve Canadians better.\\nKey actions\\nDevelop a training plan\\nBuilding on existing offerings from CSPS, the Government of Canada will develop a training plan for existing public servants. The developed training plan will be evergreen to match the pace of AI development. Through this plan, the Government of Canada will consider ways that AI may reshape the workforce, working with employees and their bargaining agents to prepare public servants for this change through retraining.\\nThe training plan will incorporate both general training and training tailored to specific personas with varying roles, levels and responsibilities. The general training will be directed at increasing understanding of and confidence in using AI, including embedded AI capabilities; developing skills associated with responsible, secure, and effective use, including effective prompt engineering; and establishing leadership programs to achieve a culture that promotes AI adoption. The tailored training will address both more specific and advanced technical skills, and the behavioural skills needed for successful adoption, such risk identification and management, and effective leadership of AI projects and teams.\\nBenchmark talent needs\\nThe Government of Canada will benchmark both talent requirements for AI and its employees’ existing AI knowledge and skills across the enterprise. These benchmarks will enable the development of learner personas with accompanying training plans and identify employees who could be offered further training.\\nDevelop a talent plan\\nSince not all talent needs can be met through training, the Government of Canada will need to develop a plan to recruit and retain talent. This plan will explore obstacles to recruitment and retention and ways to establish flexible data science career pathways for AI practitioners. It will also consider ways to expand interchanges, apprenticeships, co-op programs, and partnerships with AI institutes and research centres to create a talent pipeline. It will consider ways to make efficient use of AI talent through flexible assignments, and competitions and challenges to meet some project-based needs.\\nLearn more about: AI and data talent pathways\\nTo meet the challenge of AI talent needs, both departmental and government-wide initiatives are being developed to improve recruitment, retention, and reskilling:\\nDigital Talent Strategy and Platform:\\nThe Government of Canada is committed to strengthening AI talent and adoption through the Government of Canada Digital Talent Strategy. Its targeted initiatives include centralized AI-specific recruitment campaigns for data science graduates and the Digital Talent Platform, which simplifies the application process for individuals looking for digital careers in the Government of Canada and helps managers to find pre-qualified digital talent that matches their needs. The Strategy also focuses on developing and retaining AI talent through learning platforms, training opportunities, and partnerships with educational institutions and the Canada School of Public Service.\\nTraining:\\nCSPS offers a range of courses, events, and resources on AI designed to provide users with a grounding in the knowledge and skills needed for successful and responsible use. These include a data and AI learning pathway, courses, job aids, articles, and videos, and an AI event series.\\nCo-op programs and internships:\\nCo-op programs are widely used by the Government of Canada as a source of new talent but have also been reimagined to support specific AI initiatives. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada established an AI talent pipeline with three post-secondary institutions. Through it, AAFC hired 13 co-op students in 2023-24 and supported in-class projects with the institutions. From this partnership, students received course credit and employment experience, while AAFC received an AI model, with ownership of both IP and data. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Employment and Social Development Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and Statistics Canada have become partners with Mila, offering opportunities to recruit Mila students for internships or post-graduation roles.\\nPriority 4: Engagement, transparency, and value to Canadians\\nDespite the increasing use of AI in Canada, levels of mistrust in AI and its use are high. In public consultations on the AI Strategy, participants expressed a desire for more engagement in the process of designing and developing government AI systems, especially by those more greatly impacted by algorithmic bias or barriers to access. They asked for greater transparency about the government’s AI use through labelling of AI-generated products and information on systems in use, and for information about ways to seek explanations or recourse for decisions.\\nKey actions\\nStrengthen accountability and transparency on AI use\\nThe Government of Canada will continue to strengthen and clarify accountabilities for AI use in policy and in notifications about AI use. These will include new requirements and standard language for the disclosure of AI use, explanations of how an AI system reaches a decision, and information about rights and protections, including how to seek explanations or recourse and how to report problems. Lastly, the Government of Canada will identify those AI capabilities that it will not pursue.\\nAs part of these efforts, the Government of Canada will prioritize the establishment of a public register of its AI systems. The register will include information about all AI systems that fall within a defined scope, drawing wherever possible on information already collected through Algorithmic Impact Assessments and Personal Information Banks. The scope of the register will be defined and publicized on the register itself and will follow best practice for registers in other jurisdictions, which exclude embedded AI systems and any systems covered by specific policy prohibiting publication. The register will include information about what and how data is being used, how it was trained, and what quality assurance and privacy and security measures are in place. Where information about systems cannot be published, the Government of Canada will develop and publish alternative oversight processes.\\nDemonstrate impact and value to Canadians\\nTo ensure good stewardship of public resources, the Government of Canada will develop metrics and performance indicators to demonstrate the impact and value of AI initiatives to those we serve. This will track both the cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency of AI projects through a range of financial and non-monetary metrics, including costs of implementation, efficiencies and cost savings achieved, service improvements, increased client satisfaction, or increased program uptake.\\nThe Government of Canada will also develop a framework to track AI adoption. This framework will incorporate metrics for the deployment of AI solutions overall, but also for metrics such as collaboration, sharing, or scaling of solutions to avoid duplication of effort, maximize investment, and reduce costs. The metrics will also track departmental investments in the enablers of AI, including data, infrastructure, and talent.\\nCommit to engagement on AI\\nIn keeping with its commitments to meaningful public engagement through the Directive on Open Government, and with the duty to consult, the Government of Canada commits to early and meaningful public and stakeholder engagement on AI initiatives of significant public interest or concern. This will include targeted engagement of communities that face greater impacts, risks or barriers from AI systems and union and employee engagement on workforce impacts. It will also include client participation in system design to ensure that AI systems do not create or perpetuate barriers to access for clients. The Government of Canada will also provide mechanisms for ongoing public feedback and questions on AI used by the federal government.\\nLearn more about: Public AI registers\\nPublic AI registers are standardized, searchable databases that document the decisions, assumptions, and processes involved in the lifecycle of AI algorithms used by government organizations. AI registers usually include:\\n- A non-technical overview of the AI application’s goals, use cases, and impacts.\\n- The organizations responsible for the system.\\n- Stage and date of system development.\\nSome registers also include information on\\n- Data origins, management, processing, and quality issues.\\n- Model architecture, key features, parameters, performance, and source code.\\n- Bias, accessibility, and how those impacted were involved in system development.\\n- Risk levels and mitigation, risk-benefit trade-offs, and impact assessments.\\n- Human oversight in development, decision cycles, and monitoring.\\n- How those impacted can seek an explanation for decisions.\\n- Relevant privacy policies, information and system governance models, supplier contracts, and audit reports.\\nMost registers exclude AI that is embedded within commercial products, such as virtual assistants or spell checkers, but encourage organizations to default to reporting systems if unsure whether they qualify. They also exclude systems that fall under law or policy prohibiting public disclosure, which may be reported to oversight bodies instead.\\nFrom 2020 to 2024, under Executive Order 14110, the US government required all federal agencies to publish an annual inventory of their planned, new, and existing AI use cases, with exclusions only for very simple rule-based systems, robotic process automation, and defence systems. Other jurisdictions with AI registers include the Netherlands and Scotland, state governments of Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Catalonia, and municipalities of Amsterdam, Helsinki and San Jose.\\nExpectations for federal organizations\\nApproach\\nThe AI Strategy lays out an approach for the Government of Canada to follow in advancing its AI adoption, but there is clearly much work still to be done in pursuing its implementation. During the months following publication, TBS will be engaging departments on the actions laid out in the AI Strategy to confirm action leads and develop a detailed implementation plan including resources, responsibilities, timelines, and milestones. It will also continue to engage all departments on action implementation to ensure horizontal alignment.\\nExpectations of all federal organizations\\nAll federal organizations have a part to play in the implementation of the AI Strategy, regardless of whether they are leading actions within it. To prepare for this, all organizations should:\\n- Identify and prepare to report on their existing AI use cases and those in development, including actualized and estimated impacts of AI adoption.\\n- Identify key business problems where AI could be applied.\\n- Ensure employees have access to approved AI tools and the training required for safe, secure, and responsible use.\\n- Ensure that AI project teams have access to the necessary infrastructure and compute resources to support AI research and development.\\n- Review the alignment between their departmental policies and strategies on AI and its enablers and the AI Strategy.\\n- Review their compliance with existing policy requirements or expectations related to AI and its enablers, as set out in the 2023–2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service, the Directive on Automated Decision Making, the Directive on Digital Talent, and the Policy on Service and Digital.\\n- Review expectations on inclusive consultation within the Trust and Transparency Strategy, the Digital Standards, and the duty to consult and Principles respecting the Government of Canada’s relationship with Indigenous peoples.\\n- Identify departmental policy, process, and technical barriers to AI adoption.\\n- Review their own technical and non-technical talent needs for AI adoption.\\n- Familiarize themselves with resources such as the list of interested AI suppliers and open-source software.\\nRelevant strategies and policy\\nThe Strategy builds on existing commitments in other strategies to the responsible adoption of AI and its enablers such as infrastructure, data, cybersecurity, and talent.\\nStrategies\\n2023-2026 Data Strategy\\nDeveloping and implementing common data stewardship practices, using the Government’s data holdings to derive insights for decision making, and building both specialist capacity and data literacy within the public service through access to tools and training. Given the dependence of AI on quality data, the implementation of the Data Strategy will be a critical enabler for the success of the AI Strategy.\\nDigital Ambition\\nForesees the use of AI as part of the goal of delivering modern services with a digital mindset. It identifies the need for responsible AI, fairness and transparency to allow Canada to benefit from efficiency gains while countering potential harms from ungoverned AI. It also identifies the importance of transparency and preserving privacy in the handling of personal data to maintain the trust of Canadians.\\nApplication Hosting Strategy\\nExplains how the Government of Canada will optimize its use of cloud to maximize business value, reduce technical debt, and continue to evolve its service-focused culture.\\nCanadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy\\nInvests in public and commercial computing infrastructure to support the Canadian AI ecosystem and safeguard Canadian data and intellectual property.\\nEnterprise Cyber Security Strategy\\nSets out a risk-based, whole-of-government approach to ensure that the Government can quickly and effectively combat cyber threats and address vulnerabilities. It aims to help safeguard government systems, protect Canadians’ information and strengthen the resilience of digital government to ensure the continued delivery of secure and reliable digital services. foster the right skills, knowledge, and culture to support cyber security.\\nPolicies\\nThe AI Strategy should also be read in the context of relevant laws and policies:\\n- Policy on Service and Digital\\n- Directive on Automated Decision Making\\n- Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector\\n- Guide on the use of generative artificial intelligence\\n- Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Framework\\n- Directive on Digital Talent\\n- Digital Standards Playbook\\n- Policy on Government Security\\n- Policy on Privacy Protection\\n- Directive on Open Government\\n- Accessible Canada Act\\n- United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act Action Plan 2023-2028\\nTogether, these policies create a framework for responsible, secure and successful AI adoption.\\nEngagement and consultation\\nBetween May and October 2024, TBS engaged stakeholders, Indigenous partners, public servants, and the public on the development of the Strategy. TBS held roundtables to seek the input of academics, civil society, Indigenous organizations, industry, and labour, engaged provincial and territorial governments and other federal departments, and held a public consultation through Consulting with Canadians.\\nKey findings\\nThe findings of these engagements can be found in the What We Heard report. Key themes heard from participants included:\\nEngagement and inclusive design\\nParticipants highlighted the importance of engagement and partnerships with academia, civil society, Indigenous partners, industry, and other jurisdictions on AI adoption. They also suggested holding regular public consultations to gather feedback and ensure that AI initiatives are aligned with public expectations and collaborating with international and multilateral partners to align approaches. AI systems must be designed to meet the needs of all users, especially marginalized communities, requiring engagement with groups which have specific access or accessibility needs.\\nEthical use\\nRespondents said comprehensive ethical guidelines for AI use in the federal public service were essential. These guidelines should cover fairness, transparency, accountability, and bias prevention. Respondents suggested regular ethical audits to ensure compliance with the guidelines and prevent harmful biases.\\nPreparing the workforce\\nParticipants saw a need for comprehensive retraining programs to equip public servants with the skills to work with AI technologies, and to consult bargaining agents on retraining and impacts on public service workforce.\\nInfrastructure and data readiness\\nHigh-performance computing and cloud infrastructure should be available, secure and scalable to meet the demands of AI projects. The Government of Canada also needs continued investment in data governance frameworks to ensure that data is clean, accurate, and available for AI applications.\\nEnvironmental impact\\nThe Government of Canada should minimize the environmental impact of its AI use by deploying AI appropriately and choosing solutions that demonstrate responsible environmental practices.\\nTransparency and accountability\\nParticipants wanted clear communication about how and when AI is used, with labels for AI-generated content and published information about AI systems. They also wanted ways to seek explanations and recourse for system decisions.\\nPotential uses for AI\\nParticipants identified many administrative uses for AI, such as drafting and translating text, managing documents and inboxes, and scheduling personnel processes. They saw potential to use AI to generate insights from large public health, environmental, and economic data sets, and to extract information from legal and policy documents and public consultations to inform decisions. They also proposed using AI to make service and legal case processing more efficient.\\nNo-go areas\\nAreas cited by participants where AI should not be used included decisions on criminal justice cases, hiring, and social service eligibility, because of the risk of bias and the need for explainability and individual discretion. Participants also felt AI should not be used for mass data collection or surveillance, or to make policy decisions without human input.\\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the President of the Treasury Board, 2025,\\nISBN: 978-0-660-76811-3\\nPage details\\n- Date modified:\n","\n","Included URLs:\n"," -

Public Service\\nOn this page\\nMessage from the Deputies\\nData is an important part of everyday life that is essential to providing Canadians with the services and information that they need. Good data practices allow the government to produce stronger and better-informed policies, as well as improved delivery of effective, equitable and inclusive programs and services, among many other benefits.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of making high-quality data easily understandable and accessible. It also accelerated a shift towards working, learning and engaging with government online. To respond to the rapidly evolving needs of people and businesses across the country, government organizations worked together to quickly develop and deliver new services. This showed the importance of a strong data foundation for the public service to improve efficiency and responsiveness.\\nA clear, results-driven data strategy is necessary in a 21st century government. The public service must lead by example in the management, security and use of the data that Canadians entrust to them. As such, it is essential to build and maintain public trust through transparent data practices and the protection of privacy in accordance with policies and legislation.\\nIn 2018, the public service published the Data Strategy Roadmap for the Federal Public Service. This strategy served as a guiding star in setting “a foundation so that the Government of Canada creates more value for Canadians from the data we hold,” and drove the use of data to improve how government interacts with people, businesses, organizations and other partners.\\nFive years later, the 2023–2026 Data Strategy for the Federal Public Service (the Strategy) sets renewed priorities, goals and expectations for the federal public service. The Strategy:\\n- outlines the current policy landscape that relates to data\\n- describes a long-term strategic vision\\n- identifies actions over the next three years that will move the public service closer to that goal\\n- highlights real-world case studies that demonstrate value for Canadians because of the better use of data\\nBuilding on existing progress and work across the public service, the Strategy is organized into four mission areas focused on concrete, achievable and high-impact opportunities:\\n- Proactively considering data by design in all stages of government initiatives\\n- Effectively stewarding data for decision-making\\n- Improving user experience and maintaining trust by enabling data-driven services through data that flows securely where it is needed\\n- Empowering the public service with the talent and tools it needs\\nThe implementation of the Strategy has wide-ranging implications for federal organizations. It will require a coordinated approach among those responsible for delivering policies, programs and services and senior leaders with dedicated responsibilities for data, such as departmental chief data officers.\\nIn the immediate term, senior leaders, including deputy ministers, should take action to embed data activities and needs in initiatives from the start, inform their decisions using disaggregated data, and assess the data skills needed for managers and teams.\\nPublication of the Strategy with a focus on outcomes for Canadians is just the beginning; continued collaboration and engagement within the public service will be critical to success. Over the next three years, progress will be measured to ensure that the public service continues to focus on what matters to advance the data landscape. This includes adapting to changes and continuing to build greater knowledge from data so it can provide greater benefits for Canadians and support public good.\\nAnil Arora\\nChief Statistician of Canada\\nNathalie G. Drouin\\nDeputy Clerk of the Privy Council and Associate Secretary to the Cabinet\\nCatherine Luelo\\nChief Information Officer of Canada\\nIntroduction\\nContext\\nPublic servants develop and deliver programs and services and provide evidence-informed advice to decision-makers. These activities involve the production, use and management of data. As new technologies reshape the lives and work of people around the world, the volume of data continues to grow exponentially. For the benefit of the public, this data can be responsibly used by the federal public service to:\\n- be more effective and efficient\\n- better address complex social issues\\n- better target services to the people who need them\\n- help workers adapt to a changing labour market\\nEnsuring that privacy is protected, and that data is used ethically is essential to public trust. A public service that can manage, safeguard and use data effectively is well equipped to harness opportunities to the benefit of Canadians.\\nThere has been significant progress since the publication of the first Data Strategy Roadmap for the Federal Public Service in 2018, including:\\n- changes to government-wide policies\\n- development of departmental data strategies\\n- appointment of the first Chief Data Officer of Canada\\n- appointment of chief data officers in many government organizations\\nEach of these steps has helped transform how the public service operates, makes decisions and delivers services. Growing networks at the management and working levels, and dedicated efforts to advance data literacy, are nurturing a culture that values data and are helping to harmonize approaches to data management and use. Overall, progress made over the last five years has set the foundation for further change.\\nScope\\nThe Strategy supports government-wide priorities and aims to align and shape the landscape of federal, national and international digital and data-related initiatives (see appendices 2 and 3). This landscape includes advancing digital transformation in the Government of Canada (GC) by complementing and enhancing Canada’s Digital Ambition 2022 and building off the foundation of the Policy on Service and Digital.\\nThe Strategy expands on the Digital Ambition’s theme “Data-enabled digital services and programs,” with a focus on maximizing the public value of data and information (Priority 2.1) and managing and using data and information as strategic assets (Priority 2.3), while protecting privacy and being transparent. The Strategy also supports fully digital delivery by managing a government-wide culture shift (Priority 4.1) through actions to build the foundation for improving data literacy across the GC.\\nOther strategies are also being developed, tailored to support specific data domains, such as health and climate, or functional areas across government, such as human resources (HR) and financial management. Many government-wide initiatives, such as the Disaggregated Data Action Plan and the 5th National Action Plan on Open Government, are proceeding in parallel.\\nThe public service is also addressing other complex challenges such as human resource classification, legislative change and procurement of large-scale technical infrastructure. Although these are not discussed in detail as part of the Strategy, they are essential to the public service’s use of data as a strategic asset and will need to be monitored to ensure alignment. Appendix 2 provides more information on the Strategy’s relationship to other government-wide initiatives.\\nData in service of fairness and inclusion\\nAddressing gender gaps, racism and systemic barriers requires data to understand the issues and to measure progress to ensure that those gaps close over time.\\nStatistics Canada (StatCan) is working to bring fairness and inclusion to decisions that affect the people of Canada. Through the Disaggregated Data Action Plan announced in Budget 2021, StatCan will enable the production of the data that is needed, while maintaining its commitment to protecting the privacy of Canadians and confidentiality of their data. This work provides better insights into the lived experiences of specific population groups such as women, Indigenous Peoples, racialized Canadians, visible minorities, 2SLGBTQI+ communities, and Canadians living with disabilities, and allows for critical Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus). Data may also be broken down by geographic level as well as urban and rural populations.\\nStatCan is currently developing whole-of-government standards to enable adoption and support consistent collection and disaggregation of data to support public good.\\nThe Strategy is the result of extensive consultation and input from employees and organizations across the federal public service. The Strategy aims to be broadly applicable across domains, departments and agencies, and to the public service as a whole. All the diverse types of data used in the public service are in scope. This includes personal information, which must be managed in accordance with federal policies and legislation to foster trust in the public service as a data steward.\\nFederal organizations are encouraged to review the Strategy and align their own plans and strategies, improve their internal and external services and operations, and contribute to GC-wide efforts. It will also be important to coordinate across federal organizations where appropriate and share best practices.\\nFunding, authorities and procurement of digital technologies required to achieve the actions in the Strategy will be pursued or re-allocated, as appropriate, at the project or department level.\\nSupporting better health outcomes for Canadians: Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy\\nThe Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy creates a new enabling environment where collaborative work would support the creation of a world-class health data system, enabling Canadians to harness health data to achieve better health outcomes.\\nBuilding on lessons learned early in the COVID-19 pandemic, in the fall of 2020, the GC, together with provinces and territories, began co-developing the strategy to improve Canada’s collection, access, protection, sharing and use of health data. Co-development of the strategy included consultation and collaboration, informed by advice received by an external expert advisory group.\\nThe GC has taken into account lessons learned from previous attempts at health data sharing. The strategy does not envision a large technology system or platform for data sharing for the whole country. Rather, the strategy would guide improvements in health data management in four areas: public trust and data literacy, governance, data policies, and interoperability.\\nVision\\nThe Strategy will strengthen data-driven results and outcomes, driving the federal public service to consider data by design and effectively use data in decision-making and when enabling services, and to be empowered with the talent and tools it needs to do so.\\nThe public service of the future must be one where data is more fully and seamlessly integrated into government structures, operations and decision-making, much like the management of financial and human resources. Data is truly a strategic asset. The strategic value of data is tied to how it benefits all the people and businesses served by the GC. These benefits are outlined in the framework below as desired outcomes, and the following theoretical examples (see text box below) describe a future vision of how data may help to achieve each of these outcomes.\\nFuture vision: data enables better outcomes for people in Canada\\nIn the future, people and organizations receive government services when and how they want them. Data makes this future possible because it is stewarded and used by the government for the public good, such that effective, equitable, ethical, and inclusive services, programs and policy are delivered.\\nWhen an emergency occurs, such as unprecedented flooding, the government’s response is underpinned with enhanced evidence-informed decision-making. Data is readily available and integrated into assessments of the issue and how it affects resources, the economy, infrastructure and ultimately people and their communities. As a result, people and organizations receive the support they need quickly because the government can respond in a coordinated and timely way.\\nProspective immigrants to Canada know where they are in the application process because their own information is made proactively and securely available to them. Data helps people and businesses in Canada quickly identify and sign up for tax rebate programs they are eligible for, and applications are proactively processed in real time and without bias. Transparency and openness in how the government operates and uses data helps people feel that they have a trusted and accountable government that can deliver for them while protecting their privacy.\\nGood data spurs innovation and helps people make informed choices about things that matter. The private sector and civil society extract greater public value from GC open data by leveraging data on things like housing, transportation, and energy to develop tools that help the public confidently make decisions in their everyday life.\\nDisaggregated data is used to develop skills programs that strategically align with local job needs. Impacts on marginalized groups are better understood and programs and services are constantly improved because data is embedded throughout the life cycle of a project from planning to measuring and reporting on results.\\nIndigenous data sovereignty is a key component of Indigenous self-determination, supporting effective program and service design by Indigenous Peoples that reflects their communities’ unique needs, perspectives and circumstances.\\nFramework\\nThe data strategy framework is similar to that of the original strategy, with updates to reflect evolution over the past five years and to provide a sharper focus. Data as an asset spans the foundational pillars of talent, governance, and processes and tools, enabled by strong communication and effective change management. The guiding principles reflect foundational values and concepts.\\nSupport for Indigenous data sovereignty\\nSupport for Indigenous data sovereignty is a government-wide priority that contributes to Indigenous self-determination. Over the next three years, work co-developed with Indigenous partners will lay a strong foundation for a whole-of-government approach to support First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nations as they realize their respective visions for data sovereignty.\\nIndigenous Peoples have long recognized and emphasized the importance of data, not only to the equitable allocation of resources and the design and delivery of effective services, but also as a key part of their cultural heritage and an important means of capturing and sharing their collective stories. The recognition of the importance of Indigenous control over their own data is often referred to as Indigenous Data Sovereignty.\\nData capacity is foundational to the advancement of data sovereignty. The “Transformational Approach to Indigenous Data” is a multi-year government commitment supporting First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nations to develop the capacity they will need to collect, manage and use their own data for the benefit of their Peoples.\\nDuring the first phase (2022–23 to 2024–25), First Nations will establish Data Champion Teams. These teams will engage with rights holders to develop plans for and establish the First Nations–led network of national and regional information governance centres envisioned in the 2020 First Nations Data Governance Strategy. Inuit and Métis Nations will develop their own data strategies, identifying their long-term data and data capacity needs based on their unique histories, priorities and perspectives.\\nMissions\\nIn this section\\nWhile the public service has made progress, there is still work to be done to improve data use and management. The four missions in the Strategy were chosen to focus efforts on actions that are concrete, achievable within the next three years, and have the greatest potential return on effort. These missions and actions are meant to position the public service to realize better outcomes for Canadians.\\nMany of the actions build on work from organizations and groups across government that have shown leadership and made significant progress. The Strategy can increase the visibility of and scale these efforts for broader use. Other actions propose new activities that complement work currently underway or target specific challenges that need to be addressed to make way for future improvements.\\nMany of the missions and actions focus on the first steps needed to drive coordinated change across the public service. The actions are at various stages of development. Consultation, governance and development processes will be undertaken as appropriate within each initiative as work advances. This work will require collaboration and input from across the public service and will be successful only if all departments and agencies align and integrate the direction and intended outcomes of the mission areas into their own practices. More detail on departmental responsibilities will be included in the implementation plan that will follow the Strategy.\\nSummary\\nThese four missions show the work that will be in focus over the next three years (2023–2026):\\nThe mission areas and actions under each are at the heart of the Strategy, and are found in the section “Mission areas: Data Strategy 2023–2026,” and summarized in an “at-a-glance” format in Appendix 1.\\nImplementation\\nIn this section\\nApproach\\nTo drive the actions outlined in the Strategy and keep the federal public service accountable, a detailed implementation plan with clear deliverables will be released in late spring 2023. This plan will include timelines, milestones, key performance indicators and a communication approach. The communications will raise awareness of work underway, help coordination across initiatives, and give stakeholders information and tools to successfully complete deliverables. Communications efforts will also support long-term change management across the federal public service.\\nTo successfully coordinate this work, there is a need for dedicated capacity to support reporting, ensure coordination across the public service, and enable implementation of the missions and actions. Implementation of the actions will use existing authorities, for example through the responsibilities prescribed in the Policy on Service and Digital. Mechanisms to keep the public service accountable will include a strong governance structure supported by senior-level bodies, quarterly tracking and status updates, and an annual progress report prepared by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. This approach is similar to that of other countries, where updates on key milestones and deliverables are communicated through annual government reports or action plans.\\nUse the Data Strategy Tracker to stay updated on the progress of implementation.\\nExpectations of federal organizations\\nFederal organizations should review the Strategy and look for alignment opportunities when updating their organizational strategies. The Strategy recognizes that organizations and data domains across the government are vastly different from each other, hold various breadths and depths of data, and are all at different stages of data maturity. As such, prioritization and implementation will necessarily vary among organizations, as will their ability to participate in advancing specific initiatives. The opportunity to be involved at a more detailed level will be explored with organizations in the development of the implementation plan.\\nThat said, there are some common and immediately actionable areas which all organizations should be prioritizing:\\n- Embedding data activities and needs at the outset of initiatives, including reflecting data resourcing needs in Treasury Board submissions and Memoranda to Cabinet\\n- Striving to disaggregate data to the lowest level needed to enable service improvement that respects privacy and data security requirements\\n- Identifying the specific barriers that are limiting the ability to share data\\n- Improving management and governance of data related to Indigenous Peoples\\n- Ensuring access to data tools for data specialists and all public servants\\n- Assessing data skills needs for public servants and embedding data into HR training plans\\nDepartments and agencies should prepare to align with GC-wide direction on implementing:\\n- common approaches to data through stewardship models across operational areas like HR\\n- common data standards across the GC\\nConclusion\\nOver the next three years, the implementation of the Strategy and the actions found under each of the four mission areas will help to advance the maturity of the GC as a data-driven organization. The actions are achievable within this time frame and will provide the best return on investment of time and effort by showing immediate impacts or by building foundational elements needed across the federal public service to support future efforts.\\nWhile the GC has made progress in managing data and digital efforts in recent years, the integration of data and technology to modernize services in other parts of Canadians’ lives has advanced even faster. New energy is required across federal departments and agencies, in close cooperation with Indigenous Peoples, other levels of government and international partners, to serve Canadians credibly and in a way that maintains trust. Progress will be measured over the next three years and reported on in an open and transparent manner, with a view to adjusting the Strategy in 2026 to ensure continued and accelerating progress in serving Canadians as a modern, forward-thinking federal public service.\\nMission areas: Data Strategy 2023–2026\\nIn this section\\nThe missions aim to position the federal public service to responsibly use data to improve outcomes for Canadians and others served by the government. Across the four missions, broad areas of action are indicated in bold and are supported by more detailed, concrete actions. Each concrete action is followed by the framework pillar (Governance, Processes and tools, Talent) that it supports. Throughout the missions, the term “departments” is used and is intended to include federal departments and agencies.\\nMission 1: Data by design\\nDelivering services or helping people during a crisis requires an established data ecosystem, so the federal public service can use data strategically while ensuring that data and privacy are appropriately safeguarded. Having the right information at the right time is a significant challenge for many initiatives. This problem is often caused by insufficient planning for data needs from the outset. Whether it be designing, evolving or adapting a program, policy or service, planning for data needs at the start and integrating data throughout the initiative will enable timely monitoring, assessment, reporting and improvements to support better outcomes. There are three areas of action to improve proactive consideration of data.\\n1.1 Clarify data leadership responsibilities within and across the Government of Canada.\\nClear accountabilities for data result in greater benefits for people in Canada. This is not only because of data-driven improvements in services, programs and policies, but also because of the trust that is built through appropriate data protection and management. Recent years have seen significant changes in data roles and responsibilities across the GC landscape. Many federal organizations now have chief data officers (CDOs) or people with similar duties. The first Chief Data Officer of Canada has been appointed to provide a central point for government-wide leadership on data and information management, governance and integration.\\nWhile the Policy on Service and Digital formalized some roles and responsibilities for data, it came into force in 2020 as the CDO role was still emerging. There remains a need for clearer guidance on the roles and responsibilities of executives with respect to data, not only for CDOs, but also for all executives with accountabilities for data.\\nThe public service will establish clear accountabilities for data in planning and processes to ensure that individuals with data responsibilities are providing input to programs, policies and services as they are being established and managed.\\n- Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) will develop guidance on the roles and responsibilities of executives with accountabilities for data (Governance)\\n- TBS will initiate a review of data responsibilities in the Treasury Board policy suite (Governance)\\n- TBS will clarify roles and responsibilities, and interconnections between existing data bodies and activities (Governance)\\n1.2 Embed planning for data activities in policy, program, and service development, delivery, monitoring and evaluation.\\nTo provide people in Canada with data-driven and responsive government programs, policies and services, data needs must be considered across the life cycles of initiatives, from development, through delivery, to evaluation. This requires understanding of how data may be used for multiple purposes, including consideration of disaggregated data requirements, such as for Gender-based Analysis Plus. CDOs are building the foundations to ensure that data needs are considered at the outset of an initiative’s life cycle, and to ensure that they are consistently engaged early enough in that life cycle to provide advice. It is imperative to close the gap between data experts and those developing and delivering policy, services, research, projects and initiatives.\\nSupporting Canadians with better data by design\\nTo improve the generation of data insights and support evidence-based decision-making while protecting privacy, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is putting in place a governance measure, or “Data Frame,” in support of national security and public safety priorities. The aim of this governance measure is to ensure that data and analytics needs are scoped in at the beginning of all investment planning processes.\\nThe Data Frame is a series of questions to clarify the data and analytics needs of new investments and ensure that appropriate planning and funding is allotted to the work.\\nSince data and analytics considerations are common to all GC organizations, the Data Frame and its implementation methodology can be reused and scaled across the federal public service.\\nThe public service will insert data-related questions and criteria into the development of policies, programs and services.\\n- Central agencies will provide guidance for decision-makers on accounting for, planning for and resourcing data across the life cycle of an initiative, from program, service and policy conception through delivery and end-of-life (Governance)\\n- TBS will coordinate the development of training on raising the awareness of and familiarity with planning for data at the outset of initiatives for teams responsible for policy, program or service development and delivery (Talent)\\n- Departments will implement frameworks and processes to ensure that data is considered at the outset of initiatives (Processes and tools)\\n1.3 Provide clear expectations from central agencies related to appropriate resource allocation for data needs and operations in program, policy, and service development.\\nInsufficient planning for data across the life cycle of initiatives has been an obstacle to leveraging data’s full potential in decision-making on topics relevant to people in Canada. Data must be available at the appropriate level of disaggregated detail, and its potential usefulness to other initiatives must be considered. There have been improvements in existing processes, such as the collection and tracking of data for performance measurement, and work is advancing to assess data resource implications in initiatives. However, there remain gaps in data planning across the life cycle of an initiative, which is essential for the allocation of resources.\\nThe public service will embed data considerations into decision-making processes on funding, authorities and planning.\\n- Central agencies will enhance the data-related challenge function and require departments to strengthen the consideration of data in Memoranda to Cabinet and Treasury Board submissions (Processes and tools)\\n- Central agencies will provide guidance on strengthening the consideration of data, such as the identification of data activities that are needed throughout an initiative’s life cycle, to inform appropriate resource allocation (Processes and tools)\\n- Departments will implement a framework for the proactive consideration of data activities in Memoranda to Cabinet and Treasury Board submissions based on the guidance provided (Processes and tools)\\nEnsuring the availability of data for decision-making\\nConsidering long-term and ongoing data needs and costs in government initiatives ultimately leads to better outcomes for the people in Canada. Made up of experts, a new federal working group aims to address the challenge of assessing the financial implications of data activities in initiatives by reusing and scaling existing tools.\\nOne scalable example, built by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, is the Data-Works Costing Framework. This tool helps with resourcing requests by providing a realistic, justifiable and estimated level of effort (salary and non-salary costs) needed to govern, develop, report and share data. The Framework ensures that appropriate resources can be dedicated to the work required to ensure data serves as a foundational element in support of effective services, programs and policies.\\nMission 2: Data for decision-making\\nFrom predicting the impacts of climate change, which can help governments proactively support farmers, to analyzing the unique housing needs across the country to decide where new housing is needed, the public service needs high quality data it can trust.\\nTo measure what matters to people in Canada, support decision-making and spur innovation, a strong foundation is required to unlock the full potential of the data the government holds. There are three areas of action to improve the use of data in decision-making.\\nData standards: key to improved reporting\\nThe Public Accounts of Canada is an example of the value of a mature data framework and set of standards used to create high quality, reliable data. The Public Accounts of Canada reports on government financial transactions based on rolled-up financial data held by the Receiver General. The rolled-up data is based on departmental data.\\nThe Public Accounts of Canada has a 24-year history of unmodified audit opinions, which is upheld by the required systems, processes and procedures that ensure that the right data is collected, combined and presented following governmental policies. Each department is responsible for applying common accounting standards and reconciling its transactions to those provided in the government-wide chart of accounts.\\n2.1 Establish a data stewardship model for the management of data and standards across the federal government.\\nTo optimize the use of data in decision-making on issues that matter to Canadians, data must be stewarded with clear accountabilities, processes and common standards to support consistency, quality and sharing across the government. As GC organizations and domains develop strategies and standards to meet their unique needs, applying a whole-of-government approach to data stewardship and standardization may lead to greater insights, better support government priorities, reduce data duplication, enable interoperability, and increase operational efficiency.\\nThe public service will define data domains that are best managed across the federal government and create the structures and processes to exercise effective stewardship over those domains.\\n- TBS will develop and work with departments to implement a protocol identifying and assigning domain data stewards across the public service, with clear accountabilities for endorsement, approval and stewardship (Governance)\\n- TBS will coordinate with departments to pilot stewardship models with concrete use cases, and explore the application of common approaches to data across internal operational areas (Governance)\\n- TBS, supported by Indigenous Services Canada (ISC), will progress the development of government-wide standards on data interoperability that will further the ability of Indigenous Peoples to reclaim their traditional names, as per Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action #17 (Governance)\\n2.2 Set expectations and implement common practices.\\nMaking more connections with human resources data\\nBetter data leads to better understanding, which supports better decision-making and greater efficiencies. The Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (OCHRO) at TBS has been building out its data model to improve HR data management. By creating new connections between organizations and improving the usability of HR data, this initiative has been used to highlight the value of workforce data, define HR data stewardship on a government-wide level, and inform the development of central employee capabilities, such as the employee self-identification form.\\nStewarding data effectively ensures that it can be found, accessed, integrated and (re)used appropriately. It will be critical to ensure consistent data quality and appropriate level of disaggregated detail, so that data-informed decisions are representative of the diverse people, places and businesses served by the government. Various tools, guidance and frameworks to promote standards adoption that have been developed across government are ready to be piloted and scaled for GC-wide adoption. Clearly communicating expectations will help raise awareness of the value of standardization, enable the use of common standards across the GC, and strengthen federal capacity to inform decisions using disaggregated data in a legal and ethical manner.\\nThe public service will set expectations on best practices and establish common data standards across the GC.\\n- TBS will set expectations and work with StatCan and others to enable the use of common standards through the development of an evergreen list of standards for GC-wide adoption and the scaling of StatCan’s Reference Data as a Service (Governance/Processes and tools)\\n- TBS will set expectations and work with StatCan and others to enable data discovery, integration and reuse through the review and development of information management and data policy instruments such as the Treasury Board Standard on Metadata, development of a FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) assessment tool, and guidance on assessment of existing data for reuse (Governance/Processes and tools)\\n- TBS and StatCan will formalize and work with departments on guidance to support implementation of the recently developed GC Data Quality Framework (Governance)\\n- Departments will enhance stewardship practices and reuse, including by adopting common standards, frameworks and leveraging guidance (Processes and tools)\\n2.3 Transform data into insights.\\nTo make the best decisions for people in Canada based on thorough analysis, the federal public service needs to be able to integrate data held across the government. As the federal public service continually works across departments to deliver initiatives that impact people in Canada, decision-makers must have access to holistic analysis. Modern tools are critical to enable the use of data and to responsibly bring it together. While federal organizations and domains have been exploring solutions to enable data management, access and analysis, GC-wide approaches and guidance with respect to these tools are not available.\\nInterdepartmental data sharing for decision-making\\nTo make the best decisions on complex issues impacting people in Canada, data from numerous sources must be considered. Live data access between departments allows us to know what data other departments hold and can help support decision-making across the government. With its Interdepartmental Data-Sharing initiative, Fisheries and Oceans Canada was able to demonstrate that direct and secure access to its data catalogue by other federal organizations opened the door to new possibilities for collaboration.\\nThis cost-effective solution reduces duplication and uses web service standards and existing data infrastructure. Security and privacy considerations are integrated by default. The solution proved to be a feasible way to share data, which could be scaled across the GC to achieve priorities including open government, open data and Canada’s Digital Ambition.\\nThe public service will scale data integration solutions and infrastructure, such as data hubs, to make high-quality, integrated data available for exploration, use and decision-making.\\n- Privy Council Office (PCO) and TBS will work with departments to strengthen data literacy by developing guidance on how to integrate data into senior-level briefings for effective decision-making (Talent)\\n- TBS will bring departments together to explore the scaling of solutions such as data hubs that make high-quality, integrated data available for exploration, use and decision-making (Processes and tools)\\n- StatCan will develop guidelines on building data hubs, evolving towards more formal guidance in the Treasury Board policy suite (Processes and tools)\\nBuilding trust in data for Canadians\\nCanadians rely on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to make informed decisions about food, animal and plant products through access to quality data. Data quality creates trust with those who use it, and CFIA seeks to create that trust as part of its Data Asset Inventory (DAI)—a self-service catalogue of the agency’s datasets. The DAI integrates both the Open Government checklist and CFIA’s Data Quality Framework, a framework that aligns with its GC equivalent, which facilitates data sharing and reuse, and builds trust in the data.\\nInformation gathered through this work informs a CFIA dashboard that gives scores on quality, value, availability, and Open Government eligibility to every agency dataset in the portfolio. This helps CFIA identify data assets to release to the public and allows for performance measurement of data and increased stewardship, which supports programs and business functions.\\nMission 3: Enabling data-driven services\\nFrom sharing of information on major life events with provinces, to coordinated regulation of the transportation sector, to supporting new immigrants to Canada, the responsible, ethical and transparent sharing and use of data are key to enabling the delivery of better services to people in Canada.\\nTo tailor programs, policies and services to the needs of different population groups and target delivery to those in greatest need, a variety of data is required to understand opportunities for improvement and economic and social impact. As data is increasingly used by the federal public service, transparent practices and privacy protection are essential to building trust and improving outcomes. There are four areas of action to make better use of data to improve services.\\n3.1 Drive service design, iterative service improvements, improved user experience and better outcomes through effective data flows.\\nThe GC’s Digital Standards, the Policy on Service and Digital, and the Policy on Results are helping to advance client-centred services informed by data. However, to inform service improvements that meet the needs of people in Canada, there is work to be done to improve data on the health of these services and how this data links together. Services that embed integrated data flows and associated analytical review into service management and improvement are emerging, though they are not yet widespread.\\nThe public service will create high quality secure data flows that deliver data at the lowest level of disaggregation appropriate to enable increased understanding of clients, and to improve and tailor services, policies and programs.\\n- Departments will ensure that they have the appropriate data and analytical capacity to support improved services, including service performance management and results reporting (Talent)\\n- TBS will set expectations and departments will ensure that data is appropriately disaggregated, to enable increased understanding of clients to improve and tailor services, policies and programs, ensuring that they meet their needs while respecting quality, privacy and confidentiality (Processes and tools)\\n- TBS will set expectations and departments will implement data flows that proactively inform service performance management leveraging user feedback, operational monitoring and reporting data (Processes and tools)\\n- TBS will work with departments to identify best practices and common technical solutions and infrastructure that can enable secure data access and exchange (Processes and tools)\\n3.2 Prioritize open and responsible data flow to improve service to Canadians.\\nThe government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that secure and open data flows between partners are essential to service delivery, yet can be challenging. Departmental stewardship capacity, cultural risk-aversion, real or perceived challenges in a complex rules landscape, and technology limitations may all contribute to reduced data sharing. Ongoing work such as Privacy Act modernization helps to ensure that the GC rules framework keeps pace with the changing digital and data landscape and may help to resolve some challenges; however, this will not address all the complex issues faced by the public service.\\nThe public service will identify and address challenges to data sharing, both internally within the GC and externally with key partners.\\n- PCO and TBS will coordinate departments in a review of real and perceived data-sharing challenges including frictions in existing legislation, leveraging concrete use cases leading to recommendations (Processes and tools)\\n- PCO, TBS and departments will work with partners to explore opportunities to enhance data flow with provinces and territories, including to enable client-centred service delivery (Governance)\\n- PCO and TBS will explore opportunities for federal regulators to set expectations for data stewardship and sharing among service delivery partners (Governance)\\n- TBS will work with partners to promote data standardization to support data portability and interoperability across a digital credentials ecosystem (Governance/Processes and tools).\\n- SSC will pilot data storage and collaboration solutions for unclassified data that meet the needs of scientific researchers and serve as an initial step towards exploring and validating the infrastructure requirements to enable improved data sharing between departments (Processes and tools)\\n3.3 Set clear expectations for responsible, transparent and ethical data stewardship to maintain trust.\\nMaintaining and building public trust remains a priority for the government as it evolves its methodologies for data collection, use and sharing of increasing volumes of data. The public service must be clear and transparent; proactively communicate; engage with diverse audiences; and provide information about how data is used, collected, stored and protected.\\nThe public service must also ensure that its practices ethically safeguard data, respect diversity and inclusion, and seek to minimize biases. This includes identifying when data is derived from or consists of personal information and protecting it according to policy and legislation.\\nIn safeguarding data, the public service must also apply consistent and appropriate security classifications and plan for business continuity management. In addition, the public service must continually look for opportunities to maximize openness and transparency by default and improve public value through the release of open data, where possible.\\nThe public service will establish the necessary safeguards to ensure ethical stewardship of data.\\n- TBS and StatCan will develop a federal framework to convey principles and best practices on the ethical stewardship and use of data (Governance)\\n- TBS will develop guidance that incorporates privacy and security requirements into the development and modernization of programs, activities and initiatives to address emerging data needs and evolving data practices (Governance)\\n- TBS will set expectations and provide guidance and service standards to enhance transparency of data practices and adoption of open-by-design principles (Governance)\\n3.4 Advance a whole-of-government approach to the management and sharing of Indigenous data.\\n- ISC, in collaboration with Indigenous partners, will develop, and TBS will integrate into policy, protocols and guidance for the identification, sharing, management and governance of Indigenous data to support self-determination and data sovereignty (Governance/Processes and tools)\\n- ISC, in collaboration with Indigenous partners, will establish guidelines on training opportunities focusing on Indigenous-led training related to Indigenous Data Sovereignty (Processes and tools)\\nMission 4: Empowering the public service\\nFrom delivering dashboards using Census data that help people make important decisions, to identifying invasive pests that could impact crops, to securing data and protecting the personal information entrusted to it by people and organizations in Canada, to producing reports on the flow of people and goods across Canada’s borders, the government relies on a diverse public service that is equipped with the right talent and tools. The public service must continuously adapt to meet an increasing need for modern data skills, capacity and tools. There are three areas of action to empower the public service.\\n4.1 Promote and improve data careers in the public service.\\nIn today’s data-driven society, there is a strong demand for data talent to enable the public service to leverage and protect data to improve outcomes for those it serves. To help external recruitment efforts, the public service must improve how it communicates the unique opportunities and benefits of public sector work to impact the lives of Canadians. Internally, steps must be taken to invest further in developing existing employees and nurturing data talent. As data-driven services become the norm, talent must also reflect the diversity of the populations and communities served by the GC.\\nHarnessing talent to serve Canadians in the digital age\\nThe GC Digital Talent platform is a new way of recruiting that can help the public service find the digital talent needed to deliver services and programs. The platform enables cross-government sharing of available talent and allows for the completion of processes more quickly by streamlining applications. It also helps managers hire digital talent by matching them with candidates in different pools. The launch of more recruitment campaigns will be incremental as the process continues to evolve based on real-time feedback. Likewise, development of the platform is ongoing as new features and improvements continue to be added over the coming year.\\nThe public service will develop tools to help with recruitment and retention of data talent, and clearly communicate the career paths and opportunities available in the public service.\\n- TBS will develop a “branding” approach to enhance perception and appeal of public service data careers demonstrating the unique opportunities to make a difference (Talent)\\n- TBS will lead a communications campaign promoting diverse data careers in the public service, offering GC-wide opportunities where feasible (Talent)\\n- PCO and TBS will explore and engage with appropriate authorities regarding existing recruitment and promotion programs to create specific data opportunities and to hire and retain diverse data talent (Talent)\\n- TBS will provide guidance to managers and HR teams to address government-wide HR practices, policies and processes that can be available and used across the GC to provide clarity on the variety of existing and emerging data roles at different levels within team structures, including common approaches to job descriptions and operational models (Processes and tools)\\nContinually improving and innovating for a stronger public service\\nThe Government of Canada Data Community (GCDC) has created many new opportunities for federal data practitioners of all levels to connect; learn; exchange best practices; and improve data use, standards and governance. Launched in 2021, the GCDC is hosted at the Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) with support from more than 20 departments. Activities include publishing a monthly newsletter, charting entities in the GC Data Ecosystem, and co-hosting events like the GC Data Conference and Data Governance and Standardization Series, which each attracted over 7,000 participants. Data culture innovation is also enabled by engaging the community in co-creation projects, such as the development of a data competency framework for the GC and designing human-centred solutions to data talent needs.\\n4.2 Provide opportunities to improve the data skills of all public servants.\\nThe idea that data literacy and skills are mainly the domain of data specialists is changing – they are relevant to all public servants. While data literacy products and upskilling the workforce has progressed in recent years, the public service has an opportunity to build on and more deeply entrench this work.\\nThe public service will expand the opportunities for data skill improvement by making the necessary guidance available to existing public service employees, managers and HR teams.\\n- TBS will develop guidance and tools to support managers and teams across the public service in their assessment of data skills needs (Processes and tools)\\n- TBS will make guidance available for departments to embed data into their HR training plans (Processes and tools)\\n- CSPS and StatCan will explore opportunities to formalize upskilling and reskilling, spanning a broad spectrum of data skills needs (Talent)\\n4.3 Ensure that public servants are equipped with the appropriate tools to support their work.\\nPublic servants face ongoing challenges accessing the tools necessary to do their jobs, with inconsistent application of rules across organizations. These challenges range from access to sufficient computational power and storage; to the procurement of off-the-shelf software; to the full access to, maintenance of and use of open-source software tools. While security is non-negotiable, the current approach creates significant duplication of effort across organizations. These organizations are piloting new approaches to improve efficiencies.\\nInformation sharing to create efficiencies\\nTo help improve efficiencies and reduce duplicative efforts across the GC, the IT Strategy team at Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) has created a central repository of software assessment documents. Departments must conduct security, accessibility, privacy and architecture assessments before using new software. This often means that the same software gets assessed in different organizations. Launched as a pilot on the internal collaboration platform GCxchange, the repository already has over 100 assessments that can be accessed by all GC departments for information purposes, as a starting point to their own processes.\\nThe public service will make the necessary infrastructure and tools available to equip public servants for effective, modern data work.\\n- Departments will implement TBS-published guidance on basic software toolkits, open-source approaches, and repositories that should be available to all who need them (Processes and tools)\\n- TBS will provide guidance on planning for data programs, including compute power, protected B environments and hardware (Processes and tools)\\n- CSPS will coordinate a common location for departments to share information about the toolkits they have developed (Processes and tools)\\nAppendices\\nIn this section\\nData Strategy 2023–2026\\nAppendix 1 – Missions at a glance\\nAppendix 2 – Planned and ongoing Government of Canada initiatives\\nThe following is a sample of planned or ongoing related initiatives with relevance to the Data Strategy Renewal. There are also some example domain-specific strategies (GCwiki):\\nAccess to Information Review – Launched in June 2020, the Access to Information Review ensures that the access to information regime continues to provide open, accessible and trustworthy information to Canadians in the digital age.\\nCanada’s Digital Ambition 2022 – A government-wide plan that provides a clear and long-term strategic vision for the GC to advance digital service delivery, cyber security, talent recruitment and privacy. The plan builds on and aligns with the Digital Government Strategy.\\nThe Government of Canada Digital Standards – Form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open and user-focused. The Digital Standards guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians. These digital standards were co-created with the public and key stakeholder groups. They are living standards and will continue to evolve over time as the complexities involved in putting them into practice are better understood.\\nNational Action Plan on Open Government – The fifth action plan is the result of extensive public consultation and co-creation with the public. It consists of five themes (climate change and sustainable growth; democracy and civic space; fiscal, financial and corporate transparency; justice; and open data for results) with associated commitments to making the GC more transparent and accountable.\\nPolicy on Results – The Policy on Results sets out the fundamental requirements for Canadian federal departmental accountability for performance information and evaluation, while highlighting the importance of results in management and expenditure decision-making, as well as public reporting.\\nPolicy on Service and Digital – An integrated set of rules that provides requirements as to how federal organizations manage service delivery, information and data, information technology, and cyber security in the digital era.\\nModernizing Canada’s Privacy Act – The Privacy Act focuses on the protection of personal information held by the federal government. The Department of Justice Canada is currently undertaking a review of the Privacy Act to ensure that it keeps pace with societal and technological shifts.\\nDisaggregated Data Action Plan – Developed by StatCan, the action plan will lead to the production of detailed statistical information to highlight the experiences of specific population groups to enable more equitable programs and services.\\nAppendix 3 – Highlights from other jurisdictions\\nThe following are examples of work from other jurisdictions.\\nIn Australia’s first national Data Strategy, the government highlighted the need for maximizing the public value of data, supported by good data management and governance practices. Access to the right data and analytics enables effective delivery of services to citizens. One example from the strategy showed that real-time data sharing between jurisdictions allowed governments to quickly respond to natural disasters and focus recovery efforts on areas most affected. Valuable lessons from these experiences can strengthen the government’s capacity to prepare for future crises.\\nNew Zealand has embedded upholding Te Tiriti as a central element underpinning the Government Data Strategy and Roadmap framework. The importance of authentic partnership and collaboration with iwi and Māori is highlighted in the strategy, supported by outcomes across the focus areas. For example, the Leadership focus area includes an outcome that Māori data governance is embedded in the data system and includes initiatives such as finalizing and implementing a Māori data governance model and developing guidance on Te Ao Māori perspectives on cloud storage.\\nSimilar to the Strategy’s action on prioritizing open and responsible data flow through a digital credentials ecosystem, Ontario’s Digital and Data Strategy introduces a Digital Identity program to support user-centred services. Digital ID is intended to make it easier for Ontarians to access online or in-person services (e.g., renewing a driver’s licence or obtaining a business permit) without exchanging any physical documents.\\nA common theme seen across multiple strategies is the importance of promoting data skills across the public sector. The United States Federal Data Strategy, for example, supports this priority through initiatives including investing in training, tools and working groups and exploring joint hiring initiatives with the US Digital Service to improve access to data talent. A Curated Data Skills Catalog was created with a common vocabulary of data roles and skills in the federal data ecosystem. This tool has helped agencies develop training programs and competencies for managing data as a strategic asset.\\nAppendix 4 – Glossary of terms\\nA glossary to promote a common understanding of terms used in the Strategy is posted on GCwiki for collaboration and knowledge sharing.\\nPage details\\n- Date modified:\n","\n","Per-link CSVs directory:

Longtemps confinées aux œuvres \\nde fiction, les applications pratiques de l’IA ont connu une \\ncroissance vertigineuse et servent maintenant à trouver \\nle meilleur itinéraire sur la route, à conseiller sur des \\nfilms  qui  pourraient  plaire  ou  encore  assistent  des \\nspécialistes de la santé dans leurs diagnostics.\\n\\nIl  ne  s’agit  pourtant  que  de  la  pointe  de  l’iceberg \\ndu  potentiel  de  l’IA.  Il  est  estimé  que  les  gains \\nde productivité générés par l’introduction de l’IA seront \\ncomparables à ceux générés par l’utilisation du moteur \\nà  vapeur  lors  de  la  révolution  industrielle 1.  Déjà,  les \\ngéants du Web et des petites et grandes entreprises \\ndu secteur technologique déploient sur une base régulière \\ndes systèmes d’IA pour soutenir leur offre de services.\\n\\nLe Québec est la scène d’une vive effervescence dans \\nle  domaine  de  l’IA.  L’excellence  de  la  recherche  qui \\ny est menée a entraîné une augmentation fulgurante \\ndu nombre d’organisations œuvrant dans ce domaine \\npartout au Québec, en plus d’amener un important bassin \\nd’experts de calibre international et plusieurs grands \\njoueurs à s’y établir. Le Québec est ainsi reconnu comme \\nun pôle d’innovation majeur de l’IA à travers le monde.\\n\\nLe gouvernement du Québec a joué un rôle important \\ndans  le  développement  de  cet  écosystème.  En  effet, \\nce  sont  plus  de  475  millions  de  dollars  qui  ont  été \\nannoncés  par  le  gouvernement  lors  des  discours  sur \\nle  budget 2017-2018, 2018-2019  et 2019-2020  pour \\nsoutenir la recherche, l’augmentation de la puissance \\nde  calcul,  les  organismes  clés  en  IA,  l’adoption \\nde l’IA en entreprise, l’attraction de chercheurs étrangers \\net l’élargissement de l’offre de formation.\\n\\nFort  de  ce  potentiel,  le  Québec  a  la  possibilité \\nd’en  faire  bénéficier  également  le  secteur  public. \\nC’est  pour  cette  raison  que  la  sixième  mesure \\nclé  de  la  Stratégie  de  transformation  numérique \\ngouvernementale 2019-2023 prévoit l’adoption d’une \\nStratégie  d’intégration  de  l’IA  dans  l’administration \\npublique.\\n\\nUn écosystème reconnu \\nmondialement\\n\\nAvec plus de 14 centres de recherche dans le domaine \\nde l’IA, 10 incubateurs et accélérateurs permettant \\naux entreprises en démarrage (startups) québécoises \\nde mener à bien leurs projets innovants et un grand \\nnombre d’entreprises de tailles diversifiées, \\nl’écosystème québécois en intelligence artificielle \\nfigure parmi les plus dynamiques au monde.\\n\\nSource : Investissement Québec (2019).\\n\\n1.

En misant sur une approche globale, qui \\nplace le citoyen et l’employé de l’État au cœur de ses \\nréflexions, la Stratégie a pour objectif de :\\n\\n »\\n\\n »\\n\\nSoutenir l’utilisation de l’IA par les organismes \\npublics et d’en baliser son usage ;\\n\\nAméliorer la qualité, l’efficience et l’équité  \\ndes services offerts aux citoyens.\\n\\nLa Stratégie s’inspire des expériences vécues par d’autres \\nadministrations publiques et de l’expertise québécoise \\ndans ce domaine. Elle s’appuie sur cinq principes de mise \\nen œuvre et s’articule en trois axes principaux, regroupant \\nchacun trois objectifs que le gouvernement se fixe dans \\n\\nle  but  d’assurer  une  intégration  réussie  de  l’IA  dans \\nl’administration publique.\\n\\nEnfin, afin de concrétiser sa mise en œuvre, la Stratégie \\nest  accompagnée  d’un  plan  d’action  établissant \\nles  mesures  concrètes  à  mettre  de  l’avant  pour \\nchacun  des  objectifs  identifiés.  La  première  mouture \\nde ce plan d’action présente les mesures dont la mise \\nen  œuvre  commencera  au  cours  des  deux  premières \\nannées de réalisation de la Stratégie. Celui-ci sera par \\nla suite mis à jour annuellement et sera amené à évoluer \\nau fil des ans. Ces mises à jour régulières procureront \\nà  l’administration  publique  l’agilité  nécessaire  pour \\nadapter  ses  actions  en  fonction  de  l’environnement \\nen constante évolution et des expériences acquises.\\n\\nAilleurs dans le monde\\n\\nPlusieurs gouvernements ont adopté des stratégies ou des plans d’action encadrant le recours \\nà l’IA et encourageant son développement. Pour certains pays, il s’agit de plans visant spécifiquement \\nl’administration publique, tels que celui du Canada (Utilisation responsable de l’intelligence artificielle) \\nou de l’Italie (Artificial Intelligence at the service of the citizen). D’autres gouvernements ont, quant à eux, \\nadopté des stratégies nationales en IA comportant certaines mesures pour le secteur public, comme c’est \\nle cas pour la France (AI For Humanity) et le Royaume-Uni (AI Sector Deal).\\n\\n2\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fDÉFINITIONS\\n\\nLes définitions suivantes sont tirées de la Déclaration \\nde  Montréal  pour  un  développement  responsable \\nde l’intelligence artificielle de 2018.

Les  exemples  qui  suivent  illustrent  des \\ndomaines dans lesquels l’IA pourrait être appliquée pour \\naméliorer certains services publics.\\n\\nToutefois,  l’utilisation  de  l’IA  dans  le  secteur  public \\nn’en est encore qu’à ses débuts. Plusieurs organismes \\npublics sont actuellement à l’étape de déterminer les \\npotentialités de l’IA dans la réalisation de leur mission.\\n\\nUn agent conversationnel \\npropulsé par l’IA pour Québec.ca\\n\\nEn 2020, pour répondre à une fréquentation sans \\nprécédent du site Québec.ca en raison de la pandémie \\nde la COVID-19, le gouvernement du Québec \\nse mobilise pour donner rapidement suite aux besoins \\ndes citoyens et des entreprises.\\n\\nLa mise en place de l’agent conversationnel \\nde Québec.ca est le tout premier projet d’IA dans \\nun contexte réel de service aux citoyens au sein \\nde l’administration publique québécoise. Il s’agit \\nd’un premier pas important vers des services plus \\nrapides et adaptés aux besoins des citoyens.\\n\\nÀ titre d’exemples, le recours à l’IA par le secteur public \\npeut notamment contribuer à :\\n\\n »\\n\\n »\\n\\n »\\n\\n »\\n\\nProdiguer des conseils et des services qui \\ncorrespondent mieux aux besoins des citoyens  \\ndans différentes situations de vie ;\\n\\nOffrir un meilleur soutien à la prise de décision \\nde ses employés ;\\n\\nRationaliser les processus et optimiser l’utilisation \\ndes ressources, notamment par l’automatisation \\nde certaines tâches répétitives ;\\n\\nAméliorer la qualité des processus et des services \\nen détectant automatiquement les anomalies ;\\n\\n4\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fEn santé\\nLes avancées dans le domaine de l’IA pourraient mener \\nà une augmentation importante des services offerts aux \\ncitoyens et à un plus grand soutien relatif au déploiement \\ndes ressources dans le réseau de la santé et des services \\nsociaux.\\n\\nÀ  travers  le  monde,  l’IA  démontre  son  efficacité \\nen transformant les manières dont les professionnels \\nde la santé diagnostiquent, traitent et effectuent le suivi \\nde leurs patients.\\n\\nUne meilleure détection  \\ndes cancers grâce à l’IA\\n\\nPartout sur la planète, des chercheurs en santé \\ndéveloppent des applications permettant d’utiliser \\nl’IA pour mieux diagnostiquer certains types \\nde cancers, tels que ceux du poumon, du sein, \\nde la prostate, etc.\\n\\nGrâce au recours à une vaste quantité de données \\nmédicales, ces systèmes d’IA sont en mesure \\nd’appuyer les pathologistes dans leurs diagnostics \\nen repérant des corrélations et des motifs qui \\npourraient s’avérer trop subtils pour l’œil humain. \\nCes systèmes d’IA peuvent même être utilisés pour \\nidentifier des personnes à risque de développer \\nce type de maladie et agir en prévention.\\n\\nEn éducation  \\net en enseignement \\nsupérieur\\nLes applications de l’IA sont vouées à transformer les \\nmanières de concevoir et d’offrir les services en éducation \\net en enseignement supérieur.

L’arrivée  des  systèmes \\nde  transports  intelligents  bouleversera  l’expérience \\ndes usagers qui utilisent les infrastructures publiques, \\nnotamment  au  niveau  des  possibilités  de  mobilité \\net des informations augmentées qui leur seront rendues \\ndisponibles.\\n\\nL’IA présente des possibilités notamment pour :\\n\\n »\\n\\n »\\n\\n »\\n\\n »\\n\\nAnalyser, prédire et mieux gérer la circulation ;\\n\\nAnticiper les enjeux et les risques en matière \\nde sécurité routière ;\\n\\nInfluencer la consommation des différents modes \\nde transport ;\\n\\nPrédire la détérioration des infrastructures \\npubliques afin d’en assurer une meilleure gestion. \\n\\nDes feux de circulation contrôlés par l’IA\\n\\nLa Ville de Pittsburgh a installé des feux de circulation contrôlés par un système d’IA, ce qui a permis \\nde réduire les temps de transports de 25 % et les temps de ralentissement de 40 %.\\n\\n7\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fLES ENJEUX ÉTHIQUES  \\nDE L’INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE  \\nPOUR L’ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE\\n\\nSi son utilité et son potentiel ne sont plus à démontrer, \\nl’IA amène néanmoins son lot de questions et d’enjeux \\néthiques.  Afin  que  l’État  en  tire  le  plein  potentiel, \\nle recours à l’IA doit être ancré sur des principes établis \\nà la suite d’une réflexion approfondie des enjeux sociaux \\net éthiques.\\n\\nL’Organisation  de  coopération  et  de  développement \\néconomiques (OCDE) a aussi proposé des normes et des \\nrepères ayant pour but de favoriser la confiance dans \\nl’IA  et  son  adoption  au  sein  de  la  société.  En  2019, \\nla Recommandation sur l’intelligence artificielle 3 a été \\nadoptée par 46 pays, dont le Canada et les États-Unis.\\n\\nDes  travaux  menés  par  certains  États,  organisations \\nou regroupements ont déjà eu lieu ou sont en cours, \\nlesquels  ont  permis  de  dégager  certains  principes \\nen la matière. De ce fait, au Québec, où un écosystème \\nen IA est déjà bien positionné, une équipe pluridisciplinaire \\nregroupant des scientifiques de plusieurs universités \\na mené une réflexion qui a conduit à la publication, en 2018, \\nde la Déclaration de Montréal pour un développement \\nresponsable de l’intelligence artificielle.\\n\\nCes  exemples  d’initiatives  démontrent  la  nécessité \\nde bâtir un cadre d’action centré sur l’humain, applicable \\nà un large éventail d’acteurs, et ce, dans le contexte \\nde l’évolution rapide de l’IA. Comme celle-ci offre une \\nmultitude de possibilités et est appelée à transformer \\ncertaines pratiques de façon durable, il importe pour \\nl’État de faire en sorte que son utilisation serve le bien \\ncommun, qu’elle soit centrée sur le citoyen et son intérêt \\nsupérieur.\\n\\nIl  s’agit  d’une  initiative  ayant  comme  objectifs \\nd’élaborer  un  cadre  éthique  pour  le  développement \\net  le  déploiement  de  l’IA,  d’orienter  la  transition \\nnumérique afin que tous puissent bénéficier de cette \\nrévolution technologique ainsi que d’ouvrir un espace \\nde  dialogue  national  et  international  pour  réussir \\ncollectivement  un  développement  inclusif,  équitable \\net écologiquement soutenable de l’IA. Les principes qui \\nen découlent (le bien-être, l’autonomie, l’intimité et la vie \\nprivée, la solidarité, la démocratie, l’équité, l’inclusion, \\nla  prudence,  la  responsabilité  et  la  soutenabilité \\nenvironnementale)  cherchent  à  poser  les  bases \\nde la confiance sociale envers les systèmes d’IA.\\n\\nL’IA peut, par exemple, poser certains risques concernant \\nla démocratie, l’équité et l’inclusion. Ceux-ci doivent être \\nidentifiés et mitigés afin que l’IA puisse contribuer à rendre \\nles sociétés plus justes et équitables. Il en va par ailleurs \\nde même pour les biais que les algorithmes peuvent \\nreproduire,  lesquels  pourraient  renforcer  diverses \\nformes de discrimination (ex. : socio-économique, liée \\nau sexe, à l’orientation sexuelle ou à l’origine ethnique). \\nDes questions relatives au maintien et à l’expression \\nde la diversité sociale et culturelle doivent également \\nêtre prises en compte. C’est en s’inscrivant dans cette \\nréflexion  que  l’utilisation  de  l’IA  pourra  se  déployer \\nde manière optimale.\\n\\n3.  Le document présente 5 principes : croissance inclusive, développement durable et bien-être ; valeurs centrées sur l’humain et équité ; \\n\\ntransparence et explicabilité ; robustesse, sûreté et sécurité ; responsabilité.\\n\\n8\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fL’IA soulève aussi des enjeux relatifs à la protection \\nde la vie privée. En effet, il est possible de constater des \\nenjeux d’arrimage entre les principes de transparence \\net de protection des données et le besoin de données plus \\nprécises et détaillées pour raffiner les algorithmes. Dans \\nce contexte, la transparence, l’imputabilité et la sécurité \\ndes données se doivent d’autant plus d’être assurées.\\n\\nLa question du développement durable est également \\nau  cœur  des  réflexions  entourant  l’IA,  laquelle  doit \\npermettre une meilleure utilisation des ressources dans \\nune  perspective  de  durabilité,  que  ce  soit  au  niveau \\nde la prise en compte de l’impact environnemental dans \\nles applications de l’IA, ou encore l’empreinte écologique \\ndes infrastructures technologiques nécessaires.\\n\\nEn somme, le domaine de l’IA appelle la mise en place \\nde  balises  pour  encadrer  son  développement  et  son \\nutilisation. La présente Stratégie, à l’instar de l’éventail \\ndes  actions  du  gouvernement  dans  les  domaines \\ndu numérique et de la protection des renseignements \\npersonnels, vise à outiller l’administration publique pour \\nrépondre à ces enjeux tout en bénéficiant des apports \\nde l’IA. Ainsi, les ambitions et les objectifs poursuivis \\npar la présente Stratégie sont au cœur de la réflexion \\néthique entourant l’IA et le resteront tout au long de son \\napplication.\\n\\n9\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fLES DÉFIS DE L’INTÉGRATION  \\nDE L’INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE  \\nDANS L’ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE\\n\\nDans le but de proposer les meilleures actions à mettre en œuvre pour favoriser la réussite de l’intégration de l’IA dans \\nl’administration publique, le gouvernement du Québec s’est inspiré des principaux défis soulevés par la littérature \\nscientifique dans ce domaine :\\n\\n1.  Les défis technologiques regroupent les enjeux relatifs aux capacités de développement et de mise en œuvre \\ndes dispositifs d’IA dans l’administration (ex. : les enjeux de spécialisation et d’expertise, la cybersécurité, etc.).\\n\\n2.  Les défis des données regroupent les enjeux relatifs à la collecte, la préparation, l’accès, le stockage \\n\\net la gouvernance des données nécessaires au fonctionnement des dispositifs d’IA.\\n\\n3.  Les défis légaux et liés à la régulation de l’IA regroupent les enjeux relatifs à la gouvernance, \\n\\nà la réglementation et au respect des droits des individus.\\n\\n4.  Les défis éthiques regroupent notamment les enjeux relatifs à la protection de droits fondamentaux, de l’équité \\n\\net de la dignité humaine.\\n\\n5.  Les défis sociétaux regroupent les enjeux relatifs à l’acceptation des dispositifs d’IA dans l’administration, \\nà la compréhension des notions associées à ces technologies ainsi qu’aux transformations sociétales \\net politiques produites par l’IA.\\n\\n6.  Les défis managériaux regroupent les enjeux relatifs à la transformation des pratiques de travail au sein \\n\\nde l’administration publique.\\n\\nLa Stratégie aborde ces défis et propose d’y apporter des solutions et de mettre en œuvre des mécanismes concrets \\npour l’ensemble de l’administration publique québécoise.\\n\\n10\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans

Ces derniers guideront sa mise en œuvre et devront être pris \\nen compte dans chacune des actions qui en découlent.\\n\\nPRINCIPE 1\\n\\nL’amélioration des services aux citoyens et la performance  \\nde l’administration publique guident les actions en matière d’IA\\n\\nLes mesures mises de l’avant dans le cadre de la Stratégie ont pour finalités l’amélioration de la qualité des services aux \\ncitoyens et de la performance de l’État, notamment par la réduction des coûts et des délais. L’IA représente un puissant \\nlevier sur lequel les organismes publics et les employés de l’État peuvent s’appuyer pour atteindre ces objectifs.\\n\\nPRINCIPE 2\\n\\nLe respect et l’accompagnement des employés  \\nde l’État sont au cœur des priorités\\n\\nL’administration publique n’intègre pas l’IA pour remplacer l’humain : elle l’intègre pour tirer avantage du meilleur \\nde ce que l’humain et la technologie ont à offrir. L’IA est d’abord et avant tout un outil grâce auquel les employés \\nde l’État pourront maximiser leur capacité à offrir un service de qualité aux citoyens.\\n\\nEn  ce  sens,  le  gouvernement  veillera  à  ce  que  les  employés  de  l’État,  dont  les  emplois  seront  transformés  \\npar l’intégration de l’IA, bénéficient d’un accompagnement particulier et respectueux.\\n\\nPRINCIPE 3\\n\\nL’équité et le respect de la vie privée ne peuvent être compromis\\n\\nLa perspective de l’intégration de l’IA dans l’administration publique peut parfois susciter certaines appréhensions \\nde la part de la population, particulièrement en ce qui concerne le respect de la vie privée et l’équité lors des services \\nofferts aux personnes. Le gouvernement s’engage à ce que ces valeurs fondamentales de la société québécoise ne soient \\njamais compromises et à ce que les plus hauts standards en matière d’éthique et de cybersécurité soient appliqués.\\n\\nPRINCIPE 4\\n\\nLa prise de décision demeure sous la responsabilité du personnel de l’État\\n\\nL’intégration de l’IA dans l’administration publique amène plusieurs personnes à se questionner sur son effet potentiel \\nsur la prise de décisions qui pourraient affecter les individus. Il est légitime de se poser la question : « Dans le traitement \\nde mon dossier, la décision finale sera-t-elle prise par un robot ? ». Le gouvernement tient à rassurer les citoyens et les \\ncitoyennes sur cette question : les décisions pouvant affecter les droits des citoyens demeureront sous le contrôle \\ndéfinitif d’un humain.\\n\\n12\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fPRINCIPE 5\\n\\nL’administration publique prend appui sur le génie québécois  \\nen IA et entretient des liens forts avec l’écosystème\\n\\nIl  ne  fait  aucun  doute  que  le  travail  en  réseau  constitue  l’une  des  clés  du  succès  de  l’intégration  de  l’IA  dans \\nl’administration publique québécoise.\\n\\nL’expertise et la renommée du Québec en matière d’IA ne sont plus à démontrer. De nombreux centres de recherche \\net des entités spécialisées dans ce créneau hautement novateur se sont établis sur le territoire au cours des dernières \\nannées.\\n\\nAfin de mener à bien les objectifs qu’elle se fixe dans la Stratégie, il est primordial que l’administration publique travaille \\nau développement de collaborations durables et mutuellement bénéfiques avec les forces vives de l’écosystème \\nquébécois en IA. De telles collaborations permettront à l’ensemble de la communauté gouvernementale québécoise \\nde bénéficier d’expertise, d’apprentissages communs, d’idées innovantes et de soutien dans la réalisation de ses \\ninitiatives en IA, tout en favorisant le développement de sa propre expertise en la matière.\\n\\n13\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fAXE 1 :\\n\\nDES SERVICES PUBLICS  \\nRENOUVELÉS ET OPTIMISÉS PAR L’IA\\n\\nEn vue d’offrir des services publics renouvelés, performants et en adéquation avec les besoins du citoyen, l’appareil \\npublic doit demeurer à l’écoute de la population et faire preuve d’innovation dans la conception de ceux-ci.\\n\\nIl importe également que les organismes publics évoluent dans un environnement au sein duquel ils disposent du soutien \\nnécessaire pour mettre sur pied des projets novateurs et pour expérimenter dans le respect des principes régissant les \\nmarchés publics. Afin d’y parvenir, l’administration publique se fixe les trois objectifs suivants. \\n\\nObjectif 1 :\\nMaintenir un dialogue avec le citoyen afin de bien cerner ses besoins et ses préoccupations favorisant \\nainsi l’acceptabilité sociale de l’IA\\n\\nObjectif 2 :\\nSoutenir les organismes publics afin qu’ils tirent profit de l’IA dans le déploiement  \\ndes services publics\\n\\nObjectif 3 :\\nStimuler la culture d’innovation et d’expérimentation pour accélérer l’intégration de l’IA  \\ndans les services publics\\n\\n14\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fObjectif 1 : Maintenir un dialogue avec le citoyen  \\nafin de bien cerner ses besoins et ses préoccupations  \\nfavorisant ainsi l’acceptabilité sociale de l’IA\\nL’acceptabilité  sociale  constitue  un  facteur  clé  pour \\nl’intégration de l’IA dans l’administration publique. Du fait \\nde sa nature disruptive 4, l’IA soulève des préoccupations \\ncontinues de la part les citoyens. Les systèmes d’IA sont-\\nils conçus de manière éthique ?

Les solutions \\nde cybersécurité basées sur l’IA contribuent à une \\ndétection et une gestion plus rapide ainsi qu’à une \\nanalyse plus précise et détaillée des incidents.\\n\\nObjectif 9 : Mettre en place une gouvernance de l’IA  \\nqui assure la cohérence de l’action gouvernementale\\nPour  bénéficier  au  maximum  des  avantages \\nde  l’IA,  l’administration  publique  veillera  à  ce  que \\nle développement et la mise en œuvre des systèmes \\nd’IA  se  fassent  en  cohérence  avec  les  orientations \\ngouvernementales  en  matière  de  transformation \\nnumérique  et  dans  le  respect  des  principes \\nde  développement  et  d’utilisation  qui  seront  établis. \\n\\nAu chapitre de la gouvernance de l’IA, plusieurs défis \\nse dressent.\\n\\nD’une part, les ressources financières de l’administration \\npublique étant limitées et les projets en IA nécessitant \\ngénéralement des investissements importants, il importe \\nque les projets des organismes publics en IA s’inscrivent \\ndans une planification à long terme, garantissant une \\ncohérence entre les initiatives mises en place et tirant \\nprofit d’une mutualisation des ressources disponibles. \\nUne telle planification permettra de s’assurer que les bons \\nprojets soient réalisés au bon moment, en maximisant \\nle potentiel de transfert de compétences. De plus, les \\nbénéfices  engendrés  par  les  solutions  d’IA  devront \\nêtre démontrés de manière quantifiable et faire l’objet \\nd’un suivi régulier.\\n\\nEncadrer la prise de décision \\nautomatisée\\n\\nLe Gouvernement du Canada a adopté, en 2019, \\nune Directive sur la prise de décision automatisée. \\nCelle-ci veille à ce que les systèmes décisionnels \\nautomatisés de l’administration publique fédérale \\nsoient déployés de façon sécuritaire et efficace. Elle \\nvise, entre autres, à ce que les décisions prises par \\nces systèmes soient conformes aux lois et à atténuer \\nles incidences négatives des algorithmes.\\n\\n25\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fLes systèmes d’IA sont parfois vus comme des « boîtes \\nnoires »  qui  rendent  difficile  la  compréhension  des \\nalgorithmes  qui  les  composent.  Dans  un  contexte \\ngouvernemental et dans un souci d’assurer la sécurité \\ndu citoyen, il est primordial que ces systèmes rencontrent \\nde hauts standards de transparence et d’intelligibilité \\nassurant leur auditabilité et faisant en sorte que les \\norganismes publics qui y ont recours puissent comprendre \\net expliquer leur fonctionnement.\\n\\nUn encadrement adéquat permettra à l’administration \\npublique  d’exploiter  le  plein  potentiel  de  l’IA  dans \\nle domaine de la prestation de services, tout en réduisant \\nles risques et les effets négatifs pour les citoyens et les \\norganismes publics.\\n\\nD’autre  part,  si  l’intégration  de  l’IA  comporte  des \\navantages  indéniables,  tels  que  l’accélération  des \\nprocessus administratifs ou le déploiement de certaines \\nressources  humaines  au  profit  d’autres  tâches \\ngénérant davantage de valeur pour le citoyen, le fait \\nque des décisions puissent être prises ou influencées \\npar  des  systèmes  d’IA  pose  un  défi  de  taille \\nen matière de gouvernance : celui de la responsabilité \\net de la reddition de comptes relatives à l’action des \\nsystèmes automatisés et autoapprenants.\\n\\nEn ce sens, l’administration publique travaillera à fixer les \\nresponsabilités des différents intervenants et à encadrer \\nl’utilisation de l’IA, en cohérence avec les attentes des \\ncitoyens en matière de cybersécurité, de transparence \\ndes systèmes d’IA et de confidentialité.\\n\\nL’administration  publique  devra  donc  se  doter \\nde mécanismes de surveillance qui auront pour objectif \\nde garantir une utilisation responsable des systèmes \\nd’IA  par  les  organismes  publics  et  de  préserver \\nla confiance des citoyens.\\n\\nTravailler de concert avec l’écosystème en IA\\n\\nCréé en 2019 au Royaume-Uni, le Conseil en intelligence artificielle (AI Council) réunit des experts provenant \\nde l’industrie en intelligence artificielle, du milieu universitaire ainsi que du secteur public. Cette instance vise \\nà fournir un espace de dialogue et d’échange d’idées entre ces trois secteurs, conseiller le gouvernement \\nsur ses priorités en IA et les possibilités qui s’offrent à lui, échanger sur les nouveaux développements dans \\nle domaine de l’IA et travailler sur la perception du public face à ces nouvelles technologies.\\n\\n26\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle  dans l’administration publique 2021 • 2026\fMISE EN ŒUVRE ET SUIVI\\n\\nLa Stratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle \\ndans  l’administration  publique  2021-2026  est \\naccompagnée de mesures clés établissant les actions \\nconcrètes à mettre de l’avant pour chacun des objectifs \\nqui la composent. Le premier document de mesures clés \\nprésente les actions dont la mise en œuvre commencera \\nau  cours  des  deux  premières  années  de  réalisation \\nde  la  Stratégie.  Celui-ci  sera  par  la  suite  mis  à  jour \\nannuellement et sera amené à évoluer au fil des ans \\nen fonction des meilleures pratiques en IA.\\n\\nLa présente Stratégie s’inscrit dans la mise en œuvre de la \\nStratégie de transformation numérique gouvernementale \\n2019-2023 et vise à contribuer, par l’intégration de l’IA,  \\nà l’amélioration globale de la performance de l’État et  \\nde la qualité et de l’efficience des services publics.\\n\\nDans sa première année de mise en œuvre, le Secrétariat \\ndu  Conseil  du  trésor  travaillera  au  développement \\nd’un  indicateur  à  ajouter  au  Baromètre  numériQc \\nqui  a  été  mis  en  place  pour  mesurer  l’atteinte  des \\ncibles  énoncées  dans  la  Stratégie  de  transformation \\nnumérique gouvernementale 2019-2023. De cette façon, \\nil sera possible, annuellement, d’évaluer l’effet global \\nde l’intégration de l’IA dans l’administration publique sur \\nl’atteinte des cibles de transformation

gouvernance des organismes publics (OP) \\nde  l’administration  publique  québécoise  dans  le  cadre  de  la  gestion  et  du  soutien  du \\npersonnel dans l’utilisation d’outils numériques d’intelligence artificielle (IA) générative. \\n\\nLe  guide  s’adresse  également  aux  employés  de  l’administration  publique  québécoise \\nsusceptibles d’utiliser, dans le cadre de leurs activités professionnelles, des solutions d’IA \\ngénérative.  \\n\\nCe guide porte sur les outils d’IA générative qui sont librement accessibles à tous et offerts \\npar un service externe, et ce, sans avoir été développés ou acquis par une organisation. \\n\\nObjectifs \\n\\nLes objectifs de ce guide sont de : \\n\\n1. Guider les OP vers une utilisation responsable et adéquate de cette technologie;\\n2. Sensibiliser  les  employés  de  l’administration  publique  aux  possibilités  et  aux\\n\\nrisques de l’utilisation d’outils d’IA générative.\\n\\nLes moyens pour y parvenir sont de : \\n\\n1. Préconiser la prudence lors de l’utilisation de l’IA générative en général;\\n2. Proposer des consignes mettant l’accent sur l’acquisition des réflexes prudents.\\n\\nCe guide est un document qui sera mis à jour de manière itérative. Le guide propose aux \\nOP et à leurs employés des éléments à prendre en considération dans l’utilisation et dans \\nl’encadrement  de  l’utilisation  des  outils  d’IA  générative,  plutôt  que  d’imposer  des \\ninterdictions ou des limitations quant à l’utilisation des outils. Il s’agit de donner aux OP et \\naux employés les moyens de faire des choix responsables et de développer de bonnes \\nhabitudes  applicables  dans  différents  contextes,  ce  qui  est  essentiel  pour  utiliser \\ncorrectement cette technologie en constante évolution. Au même titre que l’utilisation de \\ntout  autre  outil  numérique,  comme  les  réseaux  sociaux,  l’utilisation  des  outils  d’IA \\ngénérative doit être responsable.  \\n\\nCadre légal et réglementaire \\n\\nLes bonnes pratiques de ce guide doivent toujours être prises en compte parallèlement \\naux  lois,  règlements,  directives,  politiques  et  orientations  concernant  l’utilisation  de  la \\ntechnologie et des services numériques, entre autres, et sans être exhaustif : \\n\\n 3 \\n\\n\f• Loi  sur  la  gouvernance  et  la  gestion  des  ressources  informationnelles  des \\n\\norganismes publics et des entreprises du gouvernement (RLRQ, c. G-1.03);\\n• Loi concernant le cadre juridique des technologies de l’information (RLRQ, c. \\n\\nC-1.1);\\n\\n• Loi  sur  l’accès  aux  documents  des  organismes  publics  et  sur  la  protection  des \\n\\nrenseignements personnels (RLRQ, c. A-2.1);\\n• Politique gouvernementale de cybersécurité; \\n• Directive gouvernementale sur la sécurité de l’information (décret numéro 1514- \\n\\n2021 du 8 décembre 2021); \\n\\n• Exigences en matière de ressources informationnelles au regard de l’utilisation de\\nl’intelligence  artificielle  par  les  organismes  publics  (arrêté  numéro  2024-01  du\\nministre de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique en date du 28 février 2024);\\n\\n• Énoncé de principes pour une utilisation responsable de l’intelligence artificielle par\\nles organismes publics (arrêté numéro 2024-02 du ministre de la Cybersécurité et\\ndu Numérique en date du 27 juin 2024).\\n\\nStratégie d’intégration de l’IA dans l’administration publique \\n\\nAfin  de  profiter  pleinement  du  potentiel  de  l’IA  comme  outil  d’optimisation  et  de \\nmodernisation de ses processus, le gouvernement du Québec a lancé officiellement en \\njuin  2021  la  Stratégie  d’intégration  de  l’intelligence  artificielle  dans  l’administration \\npublique 2021-2026. \\n\\nCette Stratégie vise à positionner l’administration publique comme acteur exemplaire de \\nl’IA  en  prenant  notamment  appui  sur  le  leadership  du  Québec  dans  ce  domaine.  Le \\nprésent guide s’appuie particulièrement sur les trois axes de la Stratégie :  \\n\\n• Des services publics renouvelés et optimisés par l’IA;\\n• Une  administration  publique  outillée  et  proactive  à  l’égard  des  changements\\n\\nengendrés par l’IA;\\n\\n• Une action gouvernementale en IA fondée sur des pratiques responsables.\\n\\nDe plus, ce guide concourt à la réalisation de deux objectifs de cette Stratégie : \\n\\n• L’objectif 2 : Soutenir les organismes publics afin qu’ils tirent profit de l’IA dans le\\n\\ndéploiement des services publics;\\n\\n• L’objectif 8 : Encadrer la conception et l’utilisation de l’IA par des balises éthiques\\n\\net des pratiques de sécurité adaptées à l’IA.\\n\\n 4 \\n\\n\fEnfin, le guide appuie les autres mesures prévues à la Stratégie et est complémentaire à \\nces dernières. Parmi celles-ci, notons celles de doter l’administration publique d’un cadre \\nde  développement  et  d’utilisation  responsables  de  l’IA  et  d’adopter  un  cadre  de \\ngouvernance de l’usage de l’IA dans l’administration publique. Des références vers ces \\ndocuments seront indiquées lors des mises à jour subséquentes de ce guide. \\n\\nContexte \\n\\nÀ la fin de l’année 2022 et au cours de l’année subséquente, la possibilité d’utiliser des \\noutils d’IA générative dans un contexte professionnel au sein de l’administration publique \\nquébécoise  s’est  étendue  avec  une  offre  d’outils  plus  performants.  L’IA  générative  est \\ndonc apparue comme un moteur de changement majeur. À une époque où les services \\npublics visent une plus grande efficacité et une adaptation aux besoins individuels, l’IA \\ngénérative  peut  redéfinir  la  manière  dont  le  secteur  public  est  capable  d’accomplir  ses \\nmissions  et  de  communiquer  avec  les  citoyens.  Dans  ce  contexte,  la  détermination  et \\nl’adoption des outils d’IA générative sont encouragées considérant l’aide que ces outils \\nsont susceptibles d’apporter aux employés, sans toutefois les remplacer. Tout en gardant \\nà l’esprit les aspects positifs qui peuvent être générés par l’utilisation de ces outils, les \\nutilisateurs doivent également prendre garde aux risques que cela peut soulever. \\n\\nQu’est-ce que l’IA générative?  \\n\\nLa définition présentée dans cette section est tirée du Guide d’introduction en intelligence \\nartificielle1 conçu par le Centre québécois d’excellence numérique (CQEN) au ministère \\nde la Cybersécurité et du Numérique (MCN). Elle permet de comprendre ce à quoi l’on \\nréfère dans le cas de l’IA générative ainsi que les cas d’application. \\n\\nL’IA générative peut être définie comme une classe ou des types d’algorithmes issus de \\ndiverses branches, méthodes et techniques de l’IA telles que l’apprentissage machine, \\nl’apprentissage profond, le traitement automatique du langage ou la vision par ordinateur, \\nayant  des  capacités  de  générer  des  données  synthétiques,  en  texte,  images,  vidéos, \\nmusique, etc. (Gartner, 2023). \\n\\nLa  catégorisation  de  ce  concept  est  assez  ardue,  particulièrement  en  l’absence  d’un \\ndomaine d’application précis. L’IA générative peut être considérée comme une catégorie \\nde  l’IA.  Cependant,  l’implémentation  des  algorithmes  requiert  diverses  approches \\net  branches  de  l’IA.  Les  algorithmes  catégorisés  comme  génératifs  existent  depuis  \\n\\n1 À paraître. \\n\\n 5 \\n\\n \\n \\n\fdes  dizaines  d’années  comme  la  machine  Boltzmann,  le  classifieur  naïf  de  Bayes,  \\nle modèle de Markov caché et les réseaux antagonistes génératifs ou GAN (Goodfellow \\net coll., 2016) ainsi que d’autres. \\n\\nL’IA  générative  a  récemment  été  mise  de  l’avant  grâce  aux  avancées  technologiques  \\nen  matière  de  gigantesque  puissance  de  calcul  et  aux  percées  de  la  recherche, \\nnotamment  en  apprentissage  automatique,  profond  et  par  renforcement.  Actuellement, \\nces  systèmes  et  applications  comptent  parmi  les  plus  populaires  et  suscitent  à  la  fois  \\nde  l’engouement,  mais  aussi  des  débats  sur  son  utilisation.  Parmi  les  exemples  bien \\nconnus du grand public, on peut citer le modèle ChatGPT, le copilote de GitHub ou les \\nhypertrucages.\\n\\n 6 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\fCas d’utilisation \\n\\nL’IA générative offre des applications variées dans la prestation et la gestion des services \\npublics. Sans remplacer la réflexion et le jugement humains, l’IA générative peut apporter \\ndu soutien dans divers domaines d’activités.  \\n\\nVoici quelques exemples :  \\n\\nIdéation/remue-méninge :  l’IA  générative \\npeut  servir  de  catalyseur  pour  stimuler  la \\ncréativité et générer de nouvelles idées. \\n\\nCréation de contenu : l’IA générative peut \\nêtre  utilisée  pour  créer  de  nouveaux \\ncontenus, par exemple : \\n\\n1. Rédaction  de  brouillons  pour  des \\ndocuments :  aider  à  la  rédaction  de \\nbrouillons de présentations, de rapports \\net de notes. \\n\\n2. Rédaction  de  courriels :  aider  à  la \\nrédaction  de  correspondance  courante \\ntout  en  maintenant  une  communication \\nclaire et professionnelle. \\n\\n3. Création  d’actualités,  contenus  pour \\nla  publicité  et  le  marketing :  générer \\ndes contenus visant à informer le public \\ndes  initiatives  gouvernementales,  des \\nchangements  de  politique  et  des \\nservices  disponibles,  en  personnalisant \\nle  contenu  pour  différents  groupes \\ndémographiques \\npar \\nexemple. \\n\\nrégions \\n\\net \\n\\nCréation de persona : l’IA générative peut \\naider  à  développer  des  personas  pour  les \\ncampagnes de communication publique et \\nproposer  des  messages  ciblés  pour  les \\ndifférents segments de la population. \\n\\nCréation de contenus multimédias : l’IA \\ngénérative peut créer de nouveaux sons ou \\n\\nde  nouvelles  images,  voix,  vidéos  ou \\nmusique. \\n\\nProgrammation  de  code  informatique : \\nl’IA générative peut appuyer les travaux de \\nsystèmes \\ndéveloppement \\nle \\ninformatiques, \\npour \\ndébogage, \\nla \\nlangage  de \\nconversion  à  un  autre \\nprogrammation. \\n\\nl’explication  de  code  et \\n\\nde \\nnotamment \\n\\nProduction  de  listes  de  contrôle :  l’IA \\ngénérative  peut  générer  des  listes  de \\ncontrôle  à  partir  de  courriels  ou  de \\ncomptes-rendus  de  réunions  pour  assurer \\nle suivi des actions et des décisions. \\n\\nFormation : \\nl’IA  générative  peut  être \\nutilisée  de  différentes  manières  dans  le \\ncontexte  de  formation  des  employés,  par \\nexemple : \\n\\n1. Parcours  de  formation :  proposer  des \\nparcours \\nles \\npersonnalisés \\nemployés en ciblant les compétences à \\nbonifier  et  en \\nrecommandant  des \\nressources éducatives pertinentes. \\n\\npour \\n\\n2. Génération de contenu de formation : \\ncontribuer  à  créer  du  contenu  de \\nformation,  tel  que  des  manuels,  des \\nguides ou des supports de cours. \\n\\n3. Conception \\n\\nde \\nde \\nconnaissances :  aider  à  créer  des \\névaluations et des tests pour mesurer les \\ncompétences et les connaissances. \\n\\ntests \\n\\n 7 \\n\\n \\n \\n\fAnalyse de données : l’IA générative peut \\ntraiter et analyser des données, notamment \\npour aider à la prise de décision, en cernant \\nles \\nles \\nprévisions \\net \\nl’allocation des ressources. \\n\\nles  modèles  et \\nplanification \\n\\ntendances, \\n\\npour \\n\\nla \\n\\nTraitement  de  contenu :  l’IA  générative \\npeut être utilisée pour faciliter le traitement \\nde contenu déjà existant : \\n\\nde \\n\\ntransformer \\n\\n1. Vulgarisation \\nconcepts \\ncomplexes : \\ndes \\ninformations techniques ou des données \\ncomplexes en explications simples et en \\nvisuels \\nla \\nclairs \\ncompréhension. \\n2. Correction  de \\n\\nla \\nrelecture  et  la  correction  de  documents \\nofficiels,  en  s’assurant  que  le  texte  est \\n\\ntexte :  effectuer \\n\\nfaciliter \\n\\npour \\n\\nexempt  de  fautes  d’orthographe,  de \\ngrammaire et de ponctuation. \\n\\n3. Normalisation  de \\n\\nle \\n\\ntexte :  aider  à \\nuniformiser \\nle  style  des \\nton  et \\ncommunications  et  s’assurer  qu’elles \\nrépondent \\nde \\nl’administration publique et qu’elles sont \\ncohérentes  sur  tous  les  canaux  lors  de \\ncommunications officielles. \\n\\nnormes \\n\\naux \\n\\n4. Conversion  de  contenu :  faciliter  la \\nréutilisation de contenu d’une plateforme \\nà  une  autre,  par  exemple  en  adaptant \\ntextuels  pour  une \\ndes  documents \\nprésentation en ligne ou en transformant \\ndes données en infographie. \\n5. Traduction  de  contenu : \\n\\ntraduire \\n\\nrapidement du contenu. \\n\\n6. Synthèse de textes : résumer de longs \\n\\ndocuments en points clés. \\n\\nDans tous les cas d’utilisation, il est proscrit de : \\n\\n•  saisir de l’information sensible2, confidentielle3 ou personnelle4; \\n•  demander d’utiliser ou de s’inspirer de matériel protégé par des droits d’auteur; \\n•  demander à l’IA d’enfreindre ou d’aider à enfreindre une loi, une directive ou un \\n\\nrèglement. \\n\\n2 Selon le Grand dictionnaire terminologique, une information sensible est une « information confidentielle \\ndont la divulgation, l’altération, la perte ou la destruction sont susceptibles de porter préjudice à la personne \\nou à l’organisation qu’elle concerne. » Office québécois de la langue française (2020), page consultée le \\n30 novembre 2023, à l’adresse information sensible | GDT (gouv.qc.ca). \\n\\n3 Selon le Grand dictionnaire terminologique, une donnée confidentielle est une « information qui ne doit \\nêtre communiquée ou rendue accessible qu’aux personnes et aux entités autorisées. » Office québécois \\nde la langue française (2019), page consultée le 30 novembre, à l’adresse : information confidentielle | GDT \\n(gouv.qc.ca). \\n\\n4 Selon la Commission de l’accès à l’information, un renseignement personnel « est un renseignement qui \\npermet  d’identifier  une  personne  physique,  directement  ou  indirectement.  Les  renseignements \\npersonnels  sont  confidentiels.  Leur  confidentialité  découle  du  droit  à  la  vie  privée,  permettant  à  toute \\npersonne d’exercer un contrôle sur l’utilisation et la circulation de ses renseignements. » \\nCommission de l’accès à l’information (2023), page consultée le 30 novembre 2023, à l’adresse Qu’est-ce \\nqu’un renseignement personnel? – Commission d’accès à l’information du Québec (gouv.qc.ca). \\n\\n 8 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\fL’organisation  et  l’employé  demeurent  imputables  de  l’utilisation  des  résultats  générés \\npar les outils d’IA. \\n\\nRisques \\n\\nLes outils qui utilisent l’IA ont le potentiel de libérer du temps pour se concentrer sur des \\ntâches  à  plus  forte  valeur  ajoutée.  Cependant,  il  est  important  que  le  personnel  de \\nl’administration  publique  soit  pleinement  sensibilisé  aux  risques  et  adopte  de  bonnes \\npratiques d’utilisation responsable de ces technologies. Bien que cette section ne puisse \\nremplacer une analyse de risques en bonne et due forme et qu’il puisse exister d’autres \\nrisques, voici trois grandes catégories de risques à garder en tête lors de l’utilisation de \\nces outils : \\n\\nCatégorie 1 :  Risques  liés  à  l’utilisation  d’outils  d’IA  générative  par  le  personnel  de \\nl’administration publique. \\n\\nCatégorie 2 : Risques de l’IA générative liés à la cybercriminalité  \\n\\n2.1  Risques d’utilisation de l’IA générative par les cybercriminels. \\n\\n2.2  Risques  d’exploitation  des  vulnérabilités  d’un  modèle  d’IA  générative  par  les \\n\\ncybercriminels. \\n\\n 9 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\fCatégorie 1 : Risques liés à l’utilisation d’outils d’IA générative par le personnel \\nde l’administration publique \\n\\nConfidentialité  de  l’information  sensible5  et  protection  des  renseignements \\npersonnels6 \\n\\nLes  systèmes  d’IA  générative  sont  souvent  munis  de  composantes  de  collecte  des \\ndonnées  servant  à  des  fins  d’analyse  et  même  de  réutilisation  pour  améliorer \\nl’apprentissage et les performances. Par exemple, une personne peut involontairement, \\nfournir  des  informations  confidentielles,  sensibles  ou  personnelles  pour  qu’elles  soient \\ntraitées  par  l’outil  comme  données  d’entrée.  Les  données  saisies  pourraient  être \\nconservées  dans  le  système,  pour  des  fins  d’entraînement,  et  ensuite  divulguées  en \\nréponse à la demande d’un autre utilisateur qui ne devrait pas normalement y avoir accès. \\n\\nBiais \\n\\nLes modèles de langage sont entraînés sur des données existantes pouvant contenir des \\nbiais  implicites  ou  explicites,  ce  qui  peut  amener  une  production  de  texte  ou  d’autres \\nactions  biaisées.  Ces  biais  peuvent  provenir  de  différentes  sources,  telles  que  les \\npréjugés  sociétaux,  les  données  déséquilibrées  ou  les  erreurs  humaines  lors  de \\nl’étiquetage des données. Le biais dans l’IA se réfère à des tendances ou à des préjugés \\nnon intentionnels qui peuvent être présents dans les résultats produits par l’IA et créer un \\npréjudice à un citoyen ou au personnel de l’administration publique, par exemple. \\n\\nFiabilité \\n\\nL’IA générative peut parfois produire des erreurs ou des « hallucinations », c’est-à-dire \\ninventer  des  faits  dans  sa  réponse  étant  donné  qu’elle  est  basée  sur  des  modèles \\nstatistiques et ne comprend pas le sens du texte. En effet, l’IA générative peut créer de \\nfausses  informations  qui  semblent  plausibles  à  première  vue,  d’où  l’importance  de \\ntoujours vérifier les faits, même pour des questions simples. Des décisions, prises à partir \\nd’informations  erronées,  peuvent  entraîner  des  conséquences  indésirables  pour \\nl’organisme  ou  créer  un  préjudice  à  un  citoyen  ou  au  personnel  de  l’administration \\npublique, par exemple.  \\n\\n5 Voir la note 2. \\n6 Voir la note 4. \\n\\n 10 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\fDépendance technologique \\n\\nL’adoption de l’IA dans l’administration publique, au sein des entreprises ainsi que dans \\nnotre  quotidien  peut  entraîner  une  dépendance  excessive  à  ces  systèmes.  Au  sein  du \\nmonde  professionnel,  les  personnes  ayant  recours  à  ces  outils  peuvent  devenir  moins \\nenclines à effectuer des tâches analytiques ou décisionnelles sans l’assistance de l’IA, ce \\nqui peut diminuer leur capacité à fonctionner indépendamment de la technologie. \\n\\nRespect de la législation \\n\\nL’IA  générative  propose  des  informations  et  des  contenus  qui  pourraient  soutenir  une \\nprise de décisions ayant un impact réel sur les clientèles des OP (individus, communautés \\nou entreprises). Si les orientations, les actions ou les décisions adoptées ne respectent \\npas  les  lois  et  la  réglementation  en  vigueur,  elles  pourraient  générer  des  préjudices  et \\nmême  possiblement  des  sanctions.  Aussi,  l’IA  générative  n’est  pas  nécessairement \\nalimentée par les textes de loi en vigueur au Québec et au Canada et elle peut proposer \\ndes  actions  ou  du  contenu  qui  contreviendraient  à  des  lois  ou  règlements  en  vigueur. \\nEnfin, nourrir l’outil avec des renseignements personnels pourrait être considéré comme \\nune infraction à la législation entourant la protection des renseignements personnels. \\n\\nRespect de la propriété intellectuelle \\n\\nLa propriété intellectuelle (PI) est : « le résultat d’un travail de création de l’esprit qui fait \\nl’objet  d’un  droit ».7  On  reconnaît  notamment :  le  droit  d’auteur,  le  brevet,  le  modèle \\nindustriel, la marque de commerce, l’appellation d’origine et le secret industriel. \\n\\nLe risque lié à la PI concerne les incertitudes et les complications juridiques quant à la \\npropriété et aux droits sur les contenus créés par des outils d’IA générative. En effet, ces \\nsystèmes peuvent imiter, reproduire ou s’inspirer de travaux protégés par différents types \\nde  droits  de  PI  lors  de  la  génération  de  contenu,  soulevant  des  questions  de  violation \\npotentielle de ces droits. \\n\\nGénération de code non sécurisé \\n\\nLa  génération  de  code  non  sécurisé  désigne  le  risque  que  les  outils  basés  sur \\nl’intelligence artificielle produisent du code informatique qui ne respecte pas le cadre de \\ndéveloppement  sécuritaire  et  qui  peut  comporter  des  vulnérabilités  ou  du  code \\n\\n7 OQLF propriété intellectuelle | GDT (gouv.qc.ca) \\n\\n 11 \\n\\n \\n \\n\fmalveillant. Ces vulnérabilités peuvent permettre l’accès non autorisé à des données, des \\nintrusions dans des systèmes, des fuites d’informations sensibles, etc.  \\n\\nCatégorie 2 : Risques de l’IA générative liés à la cybercriminalité  \\n\\n2.1 Risques d’utilisation de l’IA générative par les cybercriminels \\n\\nL’IA est devenue un moteur d’innovation incontournable pour les organisations, y compris \\nles gouvernements. Cependant, le développement des modèles d’IA présente des défis \\nuniques en matière de sécurité.  \\n\\nL’IA  peut  être  utilisée  pour  amplifier  les  campagnes  de  mésinformation  et  de \\ndésinformation  \\n\\nLes modèles de langage peuvent générer automatiquement du contenu trompeur, tel que \\nde  fausses  nouvelles,  des  théories  du  complot  ou  des  hypertrucages,  qui  peuvent \\ninfluencer  l’opinion  publique  et  saper  la  confiance  dans  les  institutions.  La  diffusion \\nmassive de ces contenus générés par l’IA peut rendre plus difficile la distinction entre les \\ninformations véridiques et les manipulations. \\n\\nL’IA  peut  également  être  exploitée  pour  des  attaques  d’hameçonnage  plus \\nsophistiquées  \\n\\nLes modèles de langage peuvent être utilisés pour créer des courriels personnalisés et \\nconvaincants, ciblant des individus spécifiques avec des informations obtenues à partir \\nde leurs données personnelles. Ces attaques de piratage psychologique améliorées par \\nl’IA  augmentent  les  risques  de  compromission  des  identifiants  et  des  informations \\nsensibles. \\n\\nL’IA peut jouer un rôle dans la propagation de rançongiciels \\n\\nLes  attaquants  peuvent  utiliser  des  modèles  d’IA  pour  identifier  les  cibles  potentielles, \\noptimiser leurs méthodes d’infection et automatiser certaines parties de leurs attaques. \\nDe plus, l’IA peut être utilisée pour générer des variantes de rançongiciels plus difficiles à \\ndétecter par les solutions de sécurité traditionnelles, augmentant ainsi la probabilité de \\nsuccès des attaques.  \\n\\nL’IA générative renforce les menaces d'ingénierie sociale \\n\\nLes  attaques  d’'ingénierie  sociale  se  produisent  lorsque  des  auteurs  de  menace  se \\nservent  d’un  lien  social  et  de  manipulation  pour  pousser  ou  inciter  des  utilisateurs  à \\ndivulguer quelque chose qui va à l’encontre des intérêts d’une organisation, comme le fait \\n\\n 12 \\n\\n\fde fournir des détails sensibles, des mots de passe ou de l’information financière.8 L’IA \\ngénérative amplifie ces risques en permettant la création d’hypertrucages audio et vidéo \\ntrès réalistes, ainsi que de faux profils sur les réseaux sociaux, rendant ces tentatives de \\nmanipulation plus crédibles et difficiles à détecter. \\n\\n2.2  Risques  d’exploitation  des  vulnérabilités  d’un  modèle  d’IA  générative  par  les \\ncybercriminels \\n\\nLes modèles d’IA générative, bien que puissants et innovants, ne sont pas à l’abri des \\ncyberattaques. Les cybercriminels peuvent exploiter activement les failles de sécurité de \\nces systèmes, compromettant ainsi leur intégrité, leur confidentialité et leur disponibilité. \\nParmi  les  principales  menaces  pesant  sur  les  modèles  d’IA  générative,  trois  types \\nd’attaques se distinguent particulièrement : les attaques par empoisonnement, l’extraction \\nde données et les violations par abus. \\n\\nLes attaques par empoisonnement \\n\\nLes attaques par empoisonnement consistent à introduire des données trompeuses ou \\nmalveillantes dans les ensembles de données utilisés pour entraîner les systèmes d’IA. \\nCette manipulation peut amener l’IA à produire des résultats erronés, biaisés ou même \\ndangereux, compromettant ainsi son intégrité et sa fiabilité. \\n\\nL’extraction de données  \\n\\nindividus  malintentionnés  peuvent  essayer  d’accéder  à  des \\n\\nDes \\ninformations \\nconfidentielles ou sensibles stockées dans les systèmes d’IA. Des données personnelles, \\ndes informations classifiées ou même des secrets d’État pourraient tomber dans les mains \\nde cybercriminels. \\n\\nLes violations par abus \\n\\nDes  personnes  mal  intentionnées  détournent  les  capacités  des  systèmes  d’IA  pour \\ngénérer du contenu trompeur, offensant, biaisé ou préjudiciable. Notamment, cela peut \\ninclure la création de fausses nouvelles, de propagande ou de contenus discriminatoires, \\nportant atteinte à la confiance du public et à la réputation des institutions. \\n\\n8 Piratage psychologique – ITSAP.00.166 – Centre canadien pour la cybersécurité \\n\\n 13 \\n\\n\fPerte de confiance envers les institutions publiques et le gouvernement du Québec \\n\\nSi certains des risques énumérés précédemment et associés à cette technologie devaient \\nse  concrétiser,  cela  pourrait  affecter  négativement \\nla  perception  publique  du \\ngouvernement. En particulier, cela risque de diminuer la confiance des citoyens envers \\nles  actions  et  les  décisions  gouvernementales,  notamment  si  ces  risques  touchent  la \\nsécurité, la confidentialité des données ou l’éthique. \\n\\n 14 \\n\\n \\n \\n\fRecommandations à l’échelle organisationnelle \\n\\nPour  une  utilisation  responsable  et  adéquate  de  l’intelligence  artificielle,  les  OP  de \\nl’administration  publique  québécoise  doivent  suivre  l’Énoncé  de  principes  pour  une \\nutilisation responsable de l’intelligence artificielle par les organismes publics (arrêté 2024-\\n02).  \\n\\nPlus précisément pour les outils d’IA générative, les OP devraient adopter une posture de \\nprudence et préconiser l’application des principes spécifiques suivants : \\n\\n•  Protection :  veiller  à  la  sécurité  des  informations  sensibles9  ou  stratégiques  et  à  la \\nprotection des renseignements personnels.10 L’organisation demeure imputable de la \\nprotection des informations qu’elle détient; \\n\\n•  Responsabilité : assumer la responsabilité du contenu généré par l’IA, en veillant à \\nce qu’il soit factuel, légal et éthique. Il faut s’assurer que ces résultats sont cohérents, \\nvalides  et  pertinents  dans  le  cadre  du  mandat  concerné.  L’organisation  demeure \\nimputable des résultats qu’elle produit et de l’information qu’elle diffuse; \\n\\n•  Utilité :  s’assurer  que  les  outils  d’IA  générative  sont  utilisés  de  manière  efficace  et \\n\\npertinente pour répondre aux besoins de l’organisation ou des citoyens; \\n\\n•  Diligence : être diligent et proactive dans la gestion des risques et des incidents liés à \\n\\nl’IA; \\n\\n•  Neutralité : veiller à ce que les résultats générés par les outils d’IA générative soient \\nvalidés et reformulés au besoin afin d’être exempts de biais et qu’ils soient utilisés de \\nmanière équitable; \\n\\n•  Traçabilité :  évaluer  la  pertinence  de  suivre  et  de  documenter  l’utilisation  de  l’IA \\ngénérative, offrant ainsi une forme de transparence dans le suivi et la justification des \\nactions et décisions; \\n\\n•  Sensibilisation  et  gestion  du  changement :  informer  et  sensibiliser  sur  le \\nfonctionnement,  les  forces,  les  limites  et  l’utilisation  responsable  des  outils  d’IA \\ngénérative; \\n\\n•  Santé et bien-être : s’assurer que les employés ont accès à des ressources en cas \\nd’impact  négatif  par  rapport  à  leur  santé  ou  à  leur  bien-être,  selon  les  ressources \\ndisponibles au sein de l’organisation. \\n\\nLe  contexte  de  chaque  OP  est  différent.  Les  principes  énumérés  ci-haut  peuvent  être \\nbonifiés  pour  s’adapter  à  leur  contexte  particulier.  Les  organisations  ont  généralement \\ndifférents mécanismes entourant la sécurité et l’accès à l’information et la protection des \\n\\n9 Voir la note 2 à la page 9. \\n10 Voir la note 4 à la page 9. \\n\\n 15 \\n\\n \\n \\n\frenseignements personnels et ceux-ci pourraient être interpellés en lien avec l’utilisation \\nde tels outils ou d’incidents liés à leur utilisation. Il pourrait être pertinent de désigner une \\npersonne responsable pour répondre aux questions ou gérer les incidents liés à ces outils. \\n\\n 16 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\fLes bonnes pratiques individuelles \\n\\nCes pratiques prudentes sont des mesures préventives et des comportements à intégrer \\ndans la routine quotidienne afin de mitiger les risques associés à l’utilisation d’outils d’IA \\ngénérative. Voici des réflexes prudents à adopter. \\n\\n1. Ne jamais divulguer d’informations personnelles, confidentielles ou sensibles. \\n\\nLa protection des données est primordiale. Il ne faut jamais soumettre des informations \\npersonnelles11, confidentielles12, sensibles13 ou qui font l’objet de propriété intellectuelle \\nde l’organisme public à des systèmes d’IA générative. Le personnel demeure imputable \\nde  l’utilisation  qu’il  fait  des  données  de  son  organisation.  Pour  des  informations \\nla  protection  des  renseignements \\nsupplémentaires, \\npersonnels et de la sécurité informatique de votre organisation peuvent être interpellées. \\n\\nles  unités  responsables  de \\n\\n2.  Reconnaître  que  l’outil,  bien  que  puissant,  peut  contenir  des  erreurs  ou  \\ndes imprécisions. \\n\\nBien  que  l’IA  générative  soit  un outil  performant,  elle  n’est  pas  exempte  d’erreurs.  Les \\nréponses générées ne doivent pas être considérées comme des informations définitives, \\nmais plutôt comme une base à la réflexion et aux vérifications supplémentaires. Il incombe \\ndonc à la personne utilisatrice de revoir, de réviser et de vérifier les informations générées. \\nPour y parvenir, vous pouvez entre autres : \\n\\n•  vérifier la source (si elle est disponible); \\n•  vérifier l’auteur; \\n•  croiser et diversifier les sources pour corroborer les réponses de l’IA générative; \\n•  utiliser seulement les outils d’IA approuvés par votre organisation;    \\n•  solliciter l’expertise humaine; \\n•  utiliser des outils de vérification des faits : 14 \\n\\no  Recherche des faits sur HabiloMédias, \\no  Vérification des faits AFP. \\n\\nLe recours à un outil d’IA générative devrait prendre en considération le contexte dans \\nlequel  il  est  utilisé.  Par  exemple,  les  conséquences  de  son  utilisation  lorsqu’on  fait  un \\n\\n11 Voir la note 4, à la page 9. \\n12 Voir la note 3, à la page 9. \\n13 Voir la note 2, à la page 9.  \\n14 Désinformation en ligne – Canada.ca \\n\\n 17 \\n\\n \\n \\n\fremue-méninge ne sont différentes que lors d’une prise de décision critique, ce qui mérite \\ndes précautions supplémentaires. \\n\\n3. Respecter les conditions d’utilisation d’un outil en ligne.  \\n\\nIl faut s’assurer de lire et de respecter les conditions d’utilisation. Cela peut inclure des \\nrestrictions sur le type de contenu généré, des limitations de temps d’utilisation ou d’autres \\nrègles spécifiques. \\n\\n4. S’assurer de la conformité au cadre législatif et aux normes éthiques en vigueur. \\n\\nLe matériel généré par les outils d’IA générative doit respecter les lois, règles et directives \\nexistantes. Le personnel de l’administration publique demeure imputable de respecter le \\ncadre légal, les principes pour une utilisation responsable de l’IA et les normes éthiques \\ngouvernementales15 et de son organisation, s’il y a lieu. \\n\\n5. S’assurer que le canal de communication réseau avec l’IA est chiffré et vérifier \\ntoujours l’URL dans la barre d’adresse. \\n\\nS’assurer, par exemple, d’utiliser le protocole de communication « https » entre un client \\nWeb  et  un  serveur  Web  qui  recourt  au  chiffrement  afin  de  sécuriser  les  échanges  et \\nd’éviter qu’un tiers malveillant puisse y accéder. \\n\\nMême  si  des  sites  Web  ont  des  certificats  valides,  cela  ne  garantit  pas  toujours  qu’ils \\nsoient  dignes  de  confiance.  Il  faut  donc  toujours  vérifier  l’URL  dans  la  barre  d’adresse \\npour s’assurer que l’on se trouve sur le site prévu avant de saisir des informations. \\n\\n15 Secrétariat du Conseil du trésor (2009) « Éthique et valeurs : pour des choix éclairés », Gouvernement \\ndu  Québec,  consulté  le  30 novembre  2023,  à  l’adresse :  https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/ressources-\\nhumaines/ethique-et-valeurs \\n\\n 18 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\f6. Signaler toute information qui pourrait laisser croire à une fuite d’informations \\nou à la publication d’informations trompeuses, erronées ou diffamatoires au sujet \\nde l’organisation. \\n\\nCertaines  applications  d’IA  générative  conservent  les  données  qui  leur  sont  soumises \\npour  les  réutiliser  (entraîner  le  modèle).  Si  en  utilisant  ces  applications,  les  réponses \\nobtenues  laissent  croire  à  une  fuite  d’informations  ou  à  la  publication  d’informations \\ntrompeuses,  erronées  ou  diffamatoires  au  sujet  de  l’organisation,  il  faut  le  signaler \\nrapidement conformément à la procédure en vigueur au sein de cette dernière. \\n\\n7. Être prudent dans le choix des outils et se tenir régulièrement informé des mises \\nà jour, des améliorations et des éventuelles limitations de l’outil. \\n\\nAvec  la  multiplication  des  offres  d’IA  sur  le  marché,  il  est  essentiel  de  faire  preuve  de \\ndiscernement dans le choix des outils que vous utilisez. Si les grands acteurs du domaine \\nproposent des solutions fiables et reconnues, il existe une multitude d’IA dans tous les \\ndomaines  et  champs  d’applications,  dont  la  sécurité  et  la  fiabilité  peuvent  varier \\nconsidérablement. Il est crucial d’être vigilant face aux IA malveillantes ou développées \\nsans les mesures de sécurité adéquates, car elles peuvent exposer votre organisation à \\ndes  risques  importants,  tels  que  la  fuite  de  données  sensibles,  la  manipulation  des \\nrésultats ou encore la compromission des systèmes. \\n\\nPour garantir une utilisation sécurisée et responsable de l’IA, il est fortement recommandé \\nde  privilégier  les  outils  approuvés  par  votre  organisation.  Ces  outils  ont  été  évalués  et \\nvalidés pour répondre aux exigences de sécurité et de conformité. En cas de doute sur la \\nfiabilité ou la sécurité d’une IA, il est impératif de consulter les autorités compétentes au \\nsein  de  votre  organisation,  telles  que  le  service  informatique  ou  le  responsable  de  la \\nsécurité des systèmes d’information. Ils pourront vous guider dans le choix des outils les \\nplus  adaptés  à  vos  besoins  et  vous  aider  à  mettre  en  place  les  mesures  de  sécurité \\nnécessaires pour protéger vos données et vos systèmes. \\n\\nEnfin, étant donné la rapidité avec laquelle évolue la technologie, il est conseillé de se \\ntenir régulièrement informé et de consulter les directives d’utilisation les plus récentes. \\n\\n 19 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\fQui contacter? \\n\\nPour des questions concernant le guide sur les bonnes pratiques d’utilisation des outils \\nd’IA générative offerts par des services externes, n’hésitez pas à contacter la Direction \\nde  l’encadrement  éthique  de  l’intelligence  artificielle  du  MCN,  à  l’adresse  suivante : \\nencadrement.ia@mcn.gouv.qc.ca. \\n\\n 20 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\fRéférences bibliographiques \\n\\nA  Legal  and  Ethical \\n\\nframework \\n\\nfor  gen  AI. \\n\\n(n.d.).

Ils sont ainsi appelés à relever \\nrapidement de nouveaux défis à l’ère de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) et ils doivent \\ngérer les risques liés à son utilisation de façon responsable, tout en assurant \\nla protection des renseignements personnels des citoyens.  \\n\\nLe présent énoncé a pour but de fournir aux organismes publics des orientations \\nen matière de gestion des ressources informationnelles. Les principes qui y sont \\nexposés contiennent tous les éléments requis pour une utilisation responsable \\nde l’intelligence artificielle par de tels organismes. Ces principes doivent être \\nappliqués en tenant compte de l’intérêt public et sur la base des considérations \\nsuivantes, avec les adaptations nécessaires : \\n\\n•  Proportionnalité : les moyens déterminés pour mettre en pratique \\n\\nles principes du présent énoncé doivent être proportionnels aux risques \\nencourus et aux bénéfices recherchés par la démarche et la mise en œuvre \\nd’un système d’intelligence artificielle ; \\n\\n•  Universalité : l’Administration publique est composée de secteurs avec \\n\\ndifférents écosystèmes et diverses missions. Les principes du présent énoncé \\ns’appliquent dans chaque contexte sectoriel ; \\n\\n•  Fournisseurs et prestataires : les principes du présent énoncé s’appliquent, \\nmême lorsqu’un organisme public a recours à des fournisseurs et à des \\nprestataires pour des systèmes d’intelligence artificielle ou en lien avec ceux-ci ; \\n\\n•  Utilisation responsable : les principes du présent énoncé s’appliquent  \\n\\nlors de l’utilisation de systèmes d’intelligence artificielle par tout organisme \\npublic, ce qui inclut chacune des phases d’un cycle de vie de tels systèmes, \\nà savoir notamment : la phase de planification et de conception, la phase \\nde collecte et de traitement des données, la phase de construction du modèle \\nconcerné ou l’adaptation d’un modèle existant pour des tâches spécifiques, \\nla phase de test, d’évaluation, de vérification et de validation, la phase de mise \\nà disposition pour son utilisation, la phase d’exploitation et de suivi et la phase \\nde mise hors service.1\\n\\n1.

La proportionnalité \\nci-avant mentionnée implique que l’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle doit \\nêtre mesurée, équilibrée et justifiée, afin de maximiser ses avantages, tout en \\nminimisant les risques. \\n\\nChaque organisme public est responsable de s’assurer que ses partenaires, \\nfournisseurs ou prestataires respectent ces principes et que ceux-ci  \\ns’appliquent à toutes les étapes d’une démarche responsable et que cela \\nsoit intégré à la gouvernance des projets, initiatives ou systèmes impliquant \\nde l’intelligence artificielle. \\n\\nDans le présent énoncé, on entend par : « intelligence artificielle » le sens que \\ndonne le Conseil sur l’intelligence artificielle de l’Organisation de coopération et \\nde développement économiques à « système d’intelligence artificielle ou système \\nd’IA », et ses modifications subséquentes. Actuellement, cette dernière expression \\nréfère à un « système automatisé qui, pour des objectifs explicites ou implicites, \\ndéduit, à partir d’entrées reçues, comment générer des résultats en sortie tels que \\ndes prévisions, des contenus, des recommandations ou des décisions qui peuvent \\ninfluer sur des environnements physiques ou virtuels. Différents systèmes d’IA \\nprésentent des degrés variables d’autonomie et d’adaptabilité après déploiement. »2 \\n\\n2.

Elles ont modifié la manière  \\n\\nde concevoir le travail ainsi que les relations avec la population.\\n\\nIl devient alors nécessaire pour les administrations de revoir les façons de faire, d’optimiser leurs processus \\n\\net d’améliorer leur performance dans le but d’offrir des services sécuritaires de qualité aux citoyennes  \\n\\net aux citoyens. \\n\\nGrâce à sa créativité et à son esprit d’innovation, le Québec s’est positionné, au fil du temps, comme un pionnier \\n\\ndans la conception et le développement de nouvelles technologies, dont celles liées à l’intelligence artificielle. \\n\\nNotre nation est reconnue comme un pôle d’innovation dans ce secteur de pointe : c’est pourquoi nous devons \\n\\nbâtir à partir de cette fierté pour que notre État soit plus efficace.\\n\\nLe Québec a entrepris de grands chantiers pour moderniser son offre de prestations numériques et des \\n\\nchangements importants sont déjà en branle. Il est maintenant temps d’accélérer la transformation numérique \\n\\nde l’État afin que l’ensemble des citoyennes et des citoyens du Québec puisse bénéficier de services numériques \\n\\naccessibles, complets, conviviaux et sécuritaires. \\n\\nPar cette Stratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028, le Québec se donne les moyens \\n\\nd’offrir à sa population une expérience citoyenne simple et accessible, où elle se sentira en confiance et protégée.\\n\\nFrançois Legault\\nPremier ministre du Québec\\n\\nQuébec, juillet 2024\\n\\n\fMOT DU MINISTRE  \\n\\nLa création du ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique, le 1er janvier 2022, \\n\\nest un geste fort et concret qui démontre l’engagement et l’importance que notre \\n\\ngouvernement accorde à la transformation numérique gouvernementale. C’est \\n\\navec fierté que je vous présente la Stratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité \\n\\net du numérique 2024–2028, laquelle poursuit le travail entamé par la Stratégie  \\n\\nde transformation numérique gouvernementale 2019–2023.  \\n\\nMaintenant que l’ensemble des ministères et organismes sont en mouvement vers une seule transformation \\n\\nnumérique gouvernementale, la Stratégie 2024–2028 propose des actions significatives pour propulser \\n\\nencore plus loin l’administration publique. Ainsi, nous définissons notre vision d’une utilisation transparente, \\n\\ninnovante et performante du numérique, avec comme objectifs en tête d’améliorer l’expérience et la confiance \\n\\ndes citoyennes et des citoyens à l’égard des services numériques de l’État et de travailler en collaboration avec \\n\\nl’écosystème numérique québécois. \\n\\nParmi les conditions nécessaires à l’atteinte de ces objectifs figurent l’adoption d’une réelle culture numérique \\n\\nau sein de l’administration publique ainsi que le démantèlement du travail en silo. À cet égard, je tiens à saluer \\n\\nl’engagement et l’expertise du personnel du Ministère, qui saura accompagner les organismes publics dans \\n\\nla mise en œuvre de la Stratégie. \\n\\nBien sûr, la cybersécurité demeure au cœur de nos préoccupations. Le gouvernement fait de la sécurité \\n\\ndes données qui lui sont confiées sa priorité afin d’être à la hauteur de la confiance que lui accordent les \\n\\ncitoyennes, les citoyens et les entreprises. \\n\\nCes derniers ont, avec raison, de grandes attentes envers la transformation numérique gouvernementale. \\n\\nNous devons leur fournir des services plus accessibles, plus rapides et plus sécuritaires. Nous avons également \\n\\nle devoir de les accompagner dans le développement de leurs compétences numériques et de nous assurer \\n\\nde continuer à offrir des services de qualité à ceux qui sont moins à l’aise d’interagir dans l’univers numérique. \\n\\nCompte tenu de la progression constante de l’utilisation du numérique dans toutes les sphères d’activité \\n\\nde la société, la Stratégie nous permet d’être à l’écoute de la population et de répondre aux attentes \\n\\net aux besoins qu’elle manifeste.\\n\\nÉric Caire\\nMinistre de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique\\n\\nQuébec, juillet 2024\\n\\n\fMOT DU  \\nSOUS–MINISTRE \\n\\nLa transformation numérique et le renforcement de la cybersécurité sont des défis \\n\\nauxquels l’administration publique québécoise doit impérativement répondre. Partout à travers le monde, \\n\\nles administrations publiques des États sont à l’œuvre pour moderniser leurs façons de faire. Pour y arriver, \\n\\nelles misent sur les dernières innovations technologiques et le Québec ne fait pas exception. \\n\\nDepuis l’élaboration de la Stratégie de transformation numérique gouvernementale 2019–2023, l’administration \\n\\npublique québécoise a pu compter sur plusieurs autres réalisations comme la Stratégie d’intégration \\n\\nde l’intelligence artificielle dans l’administration publique 2021–2026 et la Politique gouvernementale de cybersécurité, \\n\\nen vigueur depuis 2020. \\n\\nCes dernières ont déjà permis à plus de 300 organismes publics du Québec d’accomplir des \\n\\nprogrès significatifs en ces matières. Elles ont également mené au déploiement graduel du Service \\n\\nd’authentification gouvernementale, à la création du Centre québécois d’excellence numérique ainsi que \\n\\ndu Réseau gouvernemental de cyberdéfense et à la mise en place de plusieurs initiatives comme la plateforme \\n\\nde signalement de vulnérabilité. \\n\\nLa nouvelle Stratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 est une occasion de plus pour \\n\\nl’administration publique d’exceller et de se propulser encore plus loin en matière de transformation numérique.  \\n\\nStéphane Le

Québécoises et de Québécois. La première révolution industrielle a transformé le monde de l’agriculture, \\n\\nde l’économie et la société dans son ensemble. Déjà bien amorcée, la quatrième révolution, fondée sur \\n\\nle potentiel du numérique et des données, nous conduit assurément vers une cinquième révolution avec \\n\\nl’intelligence artificielle (IA), l’automatisation et la robotisation comme principales locomotives. Conséquemment, \\n\\nces développements représentent une opportunité sans précédent d’accélérer la transformation des services \\n\\npublics favorisant la performance de l’État au bénéfice des citoyennes et des citoyens. La présente Stratégie \\n\\ngouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 s’inscrit en phase avec les progrès réalisés à ce jour \\n\\npar les organismes publics tout en misant sur un usage responsable, transparent et éthique des données. \\n\\nBien ancré dans les habitudes de vie des Québécoises et des Québécois, l’usage des appareils technologiques \\n\\nou numériques atteint de nouveaux sommets puisque selon les données de 20221, 95 % des adultes au Québec \\n\\npossèdent l’un de ces appareils. Cette proportion passe à 100 % pour les 25 à 44 ans et est de 79 % pour  \\n\\nles 75 ans et plus. De plus, ce sont 84 % des citoyennes et des citoyens du Québec qui sont propriétaires \\n\\nd’un téléphone intelligent, alors que ce taux était de 77 % en 2019.\\n\\nCette omniprésence du numérique, de même que la multiplication des plateformes technologiques de haute \\n\\nqualité offertes par un nombre croissant d’organisations du secteur privé, fait en sorte que les citoyennes \\n\\net les citoyens2 s’attendent désormais aux plus hauts standards en matière de services numériques de la part \\n\\nde l’administration publique3.\\n\\nDans ce contexte en grande évolution, le gouvernement du Québec est déjà en action. Dès 2019, il a adopté \\n\\nla Stratégie de transformation numérique gouvernementale 2019–2023 (ci–après « Stratégie 2019–2023 ») dans le but \\n\\nde fournir à l’administration publique une vision commune et cohérente en vue de réaliser la transformation \\n\\nde l’État par le numérique. \\n\\nCette vision était claire :  \\ndes services publics plus rapides et intuitifs,  \\npropulsés par le numérique.\\n\\n 1.  ACADÉMIE DE LA TRANSFORMATION NUMÉRIQUE. (2022). Portrait numérique des foyers québécois. Édition 2022, [En ligne], [https://transformation-numerique.ulaval.ca/\\n\\nenquetes-et-mesures/netendances/portrait-numerique-des-foyers-quebecois-2022/], (Consulté en avril 2023).\\n\\n 2.  Dans le cadre de la présente stratégie, le terme « citoyen » inclut les entreprises (citoyens corporatifs) lorsque cela est applicable.\\n\\n 3.  Dans le cadre de la présente stratégie, le terme « administration publique » englobe l’ensemble des organismes publics assujettis à la Loi sur la gouvernance et la gestion \\n\\ndes ressources informationnelles des organismes publics et des entreprises du gouvernement (chapitre G–1.03).\\n\\n4\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n\fLa Stratégie 2019–2023 a eu pour effet d’engager l’administration publique sur la voie de la transformation \\n\\nnumérique, notamment en fournissant des structures de gouvernance en ressources informationnelles solides, \\n\\npermettant une action concertée et structurante entre les organismes publics. \\n\\nÀ ce chapitre, la création du ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique (MCN), le 1er janvier 2022, \\n\\ntémoigne de l’importance capitale d’assurer la protection des données publiques, de tirer profit du numérique \\n\\npour améliorer la performance de l’administration publique et pour transformer les services publics afin que \\n\\nces derniers soient modernes, sécuritaires, intuitifs et accessibles en tout temps. Le Québec a fait preuve  \\n\\nd’avant–gardisme en devenant le premier État en Amérique du Nord à réunir la cybersécurité et le numérique \\n\\nau sein d’une même entité, en faisant du même souffle une mission de l’État à part entière.\\n\\nForte de la maturité acquise et des avancées réalisées dans les dernières années, l’administration publique \\n\\ndoit maintenant accélérer la cadence et redoubler d’efforts pour réaliser la transformation par le numérique \\n\\net rapidement offrir des services publics plus intuitifs et faciles d’utilisation pour les citoyennes et les citoyens \\n\\nainsi qu’améliorer l’efficience de l’État. \\n\\n\fLES PRINCIPAUX \\nACCOMPLISSEMENTS  \\nEN MATIÈRE DE CYBERSÉCURITÉ \\nET DE NUMÉRIQUE \\n\\nAvec la Stratégie 2019–2023 et l’ensemble de son action en matière de cybersécurité et de numérique, l’administration \\n\\npublique québécoise a posé les bases de sa transformation par le numérique et s’est donné l’impulsion nécessaire \\n\\nvers une vision commune de cette transformation. Le gouvernement du Québec se démarque depuis 2019 par ses \\n\\nréalisations. En voici quelques–unes :\\n\\nCRÉATION DU CENTRE QUÉBÉCOIS  \\nD’EXCELLENCE NUMÉRIQUE\\n\\nLe Centre québécois d’excellence numérique (CQEN), une entité consacrée \\n\\nexclusivement à la transformation numérique gouvernementale, a été créé en juin 2019 \\n\\navec une mission claire : accélérer et faciliter la transformation numérique en favorisant \\n\\nle partage et la collaboration. Il poursuivra son action par la mise en œuvre d’initiatives \\n\\nnumériques visant l’usage d’automatisation ou d’intelligence artificielle pour améliorer \\n\\nles services publics à portée gouvernementale.\\n\\n6\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n\fDÉPLOIEMENT DU RÉSEAU  \\nGOUVERNEMENTAL DE CYBERDÉFENSE\\n\\nCréé en 2020, le Centre gouvernemental de cyberdéfense (CGCD) est un rouage \\n\\nessentiel de la protection des infrastructures numériques au Québec. Le CGCD  \\n\\na pour mission de :\\n\\n •\\n\\nsurveiller et contrer les risques et les menaces pouvant peser  \\n\\nsur les organismes publics et les ministères ;\\n\\n •\\n\\nprendre en charge les vulnérabilités détectées au niveau \\n\\ngouvernemental afin de prévenir les incidents ;\\n\\n •\\n\\ndéployer les mesures nécessaires afin de protéger  \\n\\nles données gouvernementales.\\n\\nLe CGCD coordonne le Réseau gouvernemental de cyberdéfense, constitué de près \\n\\nd’une trentaine de centres opérationnels de cyberdéfense (COCD), ce qui lui permet \\n\\nde desservir l’ensemble des organismes publics en matière de cybersécurité.

À ce chapitre, pensons notamment aux éléments suivants qui \\n\\nfaçonnent invariablement l’offre numérique de l’administration publique :\\n\\n •\\n\\nL’accélération sans précédent des développements technologiques,  \\n\\nnotamment ceux résultants de l’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle ; \\n\\n •\\n\\nLe nombre croissant des cyberattaques dans le monde et au Québec,  \\n\\nmenaçant les citoyennes et les citoyens, les entreprises et les administrations publiques ;\\n\\n •\\n\\nLe recours accru à l’infonuagique, qui a un impact important sur les organisations  \\n\\nquant au développement et à la gestion de leurs services numériques ;\\n\\n •\\n\\nLa rareté de main–d’œuvre, incluant celle spécialisée en ressources informationnelles,  \\n\\nqui menace la capacité de maintien et d’évolution des services publics ; \\n\\n •\\n\\nLa croissance rapide de l’utilisation du numérique et de l’appétit pour les services numériques \\n\\nau sein de la population, de même que le télétravail ;\\n\\n •\\n\\nLe caractère de plus en plus crucial que représentent les données pour les organisations : \\n\\nla protection et la valorisation de ces dernières s’imposant maintenant comme un levier \\n\\nessentiel de compétitivité.\\n\\nAinsi, il devient indispensable pour le gouvernement du Québec d’adapter sa stratégie en matière de cybersécurité \\n\\net du numérique, afin qu’elle soit en adéquation avec cet environnement en perpétuelle évolution.\\n\\nLa Stratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 (ci–après « Stratégie 2024–2028 ») vise \\n\\nà propulser l’administration publique vers une vision commune renouvelée de l’action de l’État. Elle a aussi \\n\\npour objectif d’inspirer la confiance des citoyennes et des citoyens dans la capacité de l’administration \\n\\npublique québécoise à réaliser des projets porteurs de transformation par le numérique qui contribueront \\n\\nsignificativement à améliorer la qualité des services et à simplifier leur vie quotidienne.\\n\\nLa Stratégie 2024–2028 s’inspire des meilleures pratiques adoptées par d’autres administrations publiques \\n\\nà travers le monde dans le domaine. Elle prend aussi appui sur l’ensemble des apprentissages réalisés par \\n\\nl’administration publique québécoise au fil des projets de transformation numérique qu’elle a mis en œuvre \\n\\njusqu’à présent.\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n13\\n\\n\fPORTÉE ET STRUCTURE  \\nDE LA STRATÉGIE 2024–2028 \\n\\nLa Stratégie 2024–2028 s’applique à l’ensemble des organismes publics assujettis à la Loi sur la gouvernance \\n\\net la gestion des ressources informationnelles des organismes publics et des entreprises du gouvernement,  \\n\\nce qui représente plus de 300 organismes publics, dont ceux des réseaux de la santé et des services sociaux, \\n\\nde l’éducation et de l’enseignement supérieur. \\n\\nElle est un document de vision à portée globale, qui pourra être complété par des stratégies et des plans d’actions \\n\\nspécifiques à des domaines d’affaires précis. À ce titre, la Politique gouvernementale de cybersécurité, en vigueur \\n\\ndepuis 2020, et la Stratégie d’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle dans l’administration publique 2021–2026 y seront \\n\\nmaintenant associées. \\n\\nLa Stratégie 2024–2028 s’articule en trois axes, lesquels regroupent dix objectifs. Pour chacun de ces objectifs, \\n\\ndes priorités stratégiques sont indiquées pour guider les prochaines actions de l’administration publique, et des \\n\\ncibles à portée gouvernementale sont fixées afin de mesurer la progression générale de la mise en œuvre de cette \\n\\ndernière dans les domaines de la cybersécurité et du numérique. Certaines priorités stratégiques ne font pas l’objet \\n\\nde cibles, mais toutes constituent des éléments à respecter pour une action cohérente de l’administration publique.\\n\\n14\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n\fMISE EN ŒUVRE ET SUIVI \\n\\nLa mise en œuvre de la Stratégie 2024–2028 et l’atteinte des cibles gouvernementales reposent sur le leadership \\n\\nqui sera exercé par le ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique ainsi que sur l’action structurée et concertée \\n\\ndes organismes publics. L’implication de l’ensemble du personnel de l’administration publique, ce qui comprend \\n\\nles employés, les gestionnaires et les hauts dirigeants, sera un facteur de succès. \\n\\nCOORDINATION À L’ÉCHELLE GOUVERNEMENTALE\\n\\nUn suivi régulier de l’avancement de la Stratégie 2024–2028 sera effectué par le Comité de gouvernance \\n\\nen ressources informationnelles, présidé par le dirigeant principal de l’information et composé des dirigeants \\n\\nde l’information désignés en vertu de la Loi sur la gouvernance et la gestion des ressources informationnelles \\n\\ndes organismes publics et des entreprises du gouvernement. \\n\\nCONTRIBUTION DES ORGANISMES PUBLICS\\n\\nDepuis 2021, la Loi sur la gouvernance et la gestion des ressources informationnelles des organismes publics et des \\n\\nentreprises du gouvernement prévoit que les organismes publics ont l’obligation d’établir un plan de transformation \\n\\nnumérique qui se veut un vecteur d’innovation pour l’amélioration des services gouvernementaux.\\n\\nLors de leur révision annuelle, les plans de transformation numérique des organismes publics devront être \\n\\nalignés avec la Stratégie 2024–2028 et préciser comment l’organisme prévoit contribuer à l’atteinte des cibles \\n\\ngouvernementales qui les concernent. Les plans de transformation numérique permettront ainsi de structurer \\n\\nl’action des organismes publics en vue de concrétiser la vision gouvernementale en matière de cybersécurité \\n\\net du numérique.\\n\\nSUIVI ET REDDITION DE COMPTES\\n\\nMis en ligne en 2020, le Baromètre numériQc (ci–après « le Baromètre ») est un outil simple et visuel qui permet \\n\\nde partager publiquement les

transformation numérique de l’administration publique nécessite que la gestion des risques en sécurité \\n\\nde l’information soit prise en compte dès qu’elle est planifiée afin d’éviter la perturbation ou l’arrêt des services \\n\\nessentiels à la population, ou encore le vol de données. Ces défis mettent en lumière la nécessité d’assurer \\n\\nla protection des données des citoyennes et des citoyens ainsi que celles des organisations à l’égard des \\n\\ncybermenaces ainsi que la résilience des services publics et des infrastructures critiques. Ainsi, la cybersécurité \\n\\ns’impose comme un pilier essentiel de l’évolution de la société à l’ère du numérique.\\n\\nDans ce contexte, il incombe à l’État de jouer un rôle de leader en veillant à ce que sa propre transformation \\n\\nnumérique soit réalisée dans un environnement cybersécuritaire. L’exemplarité de l’administration publique \\n\\nen cette matière revêt une importance particulière, car elle constitue un facteur clé pour développer et maintenir \\n\\nla confiance des citoyennes et des citoyens à l’égard de sa capacité à prévenir les incidents de sécurité, à assurer \\n\\nla résilience de ses services offerts à la population et à conduire une transformation numérique réussie. L’État \\n\\nentend ainsi renforcer la sécurité des services publics notamment en augmentant sa capacité à cibler les \\n\\nmenaces, les vulnérabilités et à prévenir les incidents de cybersécurité. \\n\\nPour ce faire, l’administration publique se donne les deux objectifs suivants :\\n\\nOBJECTIFS DE L’AXE I\\n\\nOBJECTIF \\n1\\nRenforcer la sécurité  \\nde l’information  \\ndes services publics\\n\\nOBJECTIF \\n2\\nProtéger les données  \\ndes citoyennes et des citoyens,  \\ndes entreprises et de  \\nl’administration publique\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n19\\n\\n\fOBJECTIF  1 –  \\n\\nRENFORCER LA SÉCURITÉ  \\nDE L’INFORMATION DES SERVICES PUBLICS\\n\\nL’administration publique a une importante responsabilité envers la sécurité et la résilience des services \\n\\npublics. Elle doit notamment assurer la confidentialité, l’intégrité et la disponibilité de l’information générée \\n\\npar les services qu’elle offre à la population.\\n\\nPour bien protéger l’information, la posture de sécurité des organismes publics doit évoluer et s’adapter \\n\\ncontinuellement aux nouvelles technologies ainsi qu’aux nouvelles techniques d’attaques des acteurs malveillants. \\n\\nL’administration publique mise sur la force du Réseau gouvernemental de cyberdéfense (Réseau) pour mettre \\n\\nen place les mesures de cybersécurité et pour mutualiser les services ainsi que les expertises nécessaires \\n\\nau renforcement de la sécurité des services publics.\\n\\nEn complément, afin de détecter et de contrer les cyberattaques tentant de contourner les mécanismes \\n\\nde protection, une détection et une surveillance accrue seront déployées. En se dotant d’une vue d’ensemble \\n\\ndes tentatives d’atteintes à la sécurité de l’information, l’administration publique pourra réagir plus rapidement \\n\\net réduire les préjudices.\\n\\nCIBLES\\n\\n2024–2025\\n\\n2025–2026\\n\\n2026–2027\\n\\n2027–2028\\n\\n10 %\\n\\n20 %\\n\\n45 %\\n\\n70 %\\n\\nIndicateur\\n\\nPourcentage de centres opérationnels de cyberdéfense intégrés dans \\n\\nle service de détection et de surveillance des événements de sécurité \\n\\nofferts par le Centre gouvernemental de cyberdéfense\\n\\nSous le leadership du Centre gouvernemental de cyberdéfense, le Réseau est constitué de 26 centres \\nopérationnels de cyberdéfense soutenant 306 organismes publics.

Une augmentation \\n\\ndu nombre de services numériques implique toutefois des opportunités additionnelles d’exploitation \\n\\npar des acteurs malveillants. Qu’ils aient pour objectif le vol ou la corruption de données, l’extorsion ou l’atteinte \\n\\nà la disponibilité d’un service, les acteurs malveillants ciblent l’administration publique en raison de l’importance \\n\\nde ses services à la population, de son accès aux données citoyennes et de sa visibilité médiatique. L’identification \\n\\nactuelle des menaces et des vulnérabilités ainsi que la surveillance des événements de sécurité sont des éléments \\n\\nessentiels à la protection des services publics. Une meilleure surveillance permet de détecter rapidement \\n\\nles tentatives d’attaques et les incidents de sécurité pour en informer les organismes publics concernés. \\n\\nUne intervention immédiate élimine ou minimise les préjudices afférents.\\n\\nLa bonification des capacités gouvernementales est essentielle afin de découvrir davantage et plus rapidement \\n\\nles brèches de données et tout autre type d’incident pour diminuer les préjudices pouvant y être associés. \\n\\nL’automatisation des pratiques et l’utilisation de technologies émergentes, telles que l’intelligence artificielle \\n\\net ses capacités d’analyse prédictive, seront considérées pour décupler la capacité d’analyse gouvernementale \\n\\net améliorer la performance des processus.

Le contexte réglementaire \\n\\nmondial entourant l’IA a lui aussi évolué récemment pour répondre aux préoccupations croissantes en matière \\n\\nde sécurité, d’éthique et de confidentialité. \\n\\nLa montée en puissance de l’IA générative démontre l’importance pour le Québec d’avoir lancé la Stratégie \\n\\nd’intégration de l’intelligence artificielle dans l’administration publique 2021–2026. Toutefois, l’évolution rapide \\n\\nde l’IA et les nouveaux défis qui en résultent poussent l’administration publique québécoise à s’adapter \\n\\nrapidement. La mise en œuvre de cette stratégie repose sur des mesures clés établissant les actions concrètes \\n\\nà mettre de l’avant. Ces mesures clés continueront d’être bonifiées afin de refléter le contexte stratégique lié \\n\\nà l’IA, d’assurer une action cohérente responsable et de soutenir les projets transformateurs de services publics \\n\\npar l’usage de l’IA. \\n\\nCIBLES\\n\\n2024–2025\\n\\n2025–2026\\n\\n2026–2027\\n\\n2027–2028\\n\\nPrise de  \\nla mesure\\n\\nAugmentation  \\nde 10 % \\n\\nAugmentation  \\nde 10 % \\n\\nAugmentation  \\nde 10 % \\n\\nIndicateur\\n\\nAugmentation du nombre d’initiatives \\n\\nen intelligence artificielle  \\n\\ndans l’administration publique\\n\\n38\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n\f5.1  ASSURER UNE GOUVERNANCE ET UNE UTILISATION  \\n\\nÉTHIQUE DE L’INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE  \\nDANS L’ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE\\n\\nPlus qu’une simple technologie numérique, l’IA nécessite une approche concertée afin d’en retirer les bienfaits \\n\\ntout en limitant les biais et les dérives potentielles. Au sein de l’administration publique québécoise, cela \\n\\nse traduira par des processus de gouvernance et d’imputabilité et répondant aux différents enjeux qu’implique \\n\\nl’intégration responsable de l’IA. Ainsi, l’éthique de l’IA et son opérationnalisation demeureront un axe central \\n\\npour tout projet en IA dans les organismes publics. \\n\\nBien que l’usage de l’IA demeure un vecteur puissant pour répondre à des enjeux de performance ou de capacité, \\n\\nil ne pourra se faire au détriment des droits des citoyennes et des citoyens. L’État veillera à maintenir un cadre \\n\\nréglementaire adapté aux bouleversements induits par l’IA. À l’instar d’autres administrations à l’international, \\n\\nle Québec s’assurera de collaborer avec ses partenaires nationaux et internationaux pour fournir une réponse \\n\\nadéquate aux défis engendrés par cette technologie adaptée au secteur public.\\n\\n5.2 \\n\\nFAVORISER L’ÉMERGENCE DE PROJETS  \\nEN INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE\\n\\nL’IA présente un potentiel important pour accroître la performance et l’excellence opérationnelle \\n\\nde l’administration publique ainsi que la qualité, l’efficience et l’équité des services publics offerts aux citoyennes \\n\\net aux citoyens. L’IA peut, entre autres, être utilisée pour optimiser les processus et soutenir la prise de décision. \\n\\nLe succès des projets d’IA requiert toutefois des conditions particulières, dont une expertise de pointe, l’accès \\n\\naux données et des infrastructures technologiques adéquates et sécurisées. Ces projets doivent également faire \\n\\nl’objet d’un arrimage gouvernemental afin de cibler les cas les plus prometteurs, promouvoir l’adoption des \\n\\nmeilleures pratiques et miser sur le potentiel de mutualisation des expertises et des technologies. \\n\\nPour ce faire, le soutien des projets à toutes les étapes de la chaîne de valeur (de la conception de systèmes \\n\\nd’IA jusqu’à leur mise en production) permettra d’assurer leur alignement avec les objectifs gouvernementaux \\n\\nen matière de transformation numérique et d’accélérer la mise en production de systèmes robustes et éthiques.\\n\\n5.3  AUTOMATISER LES PROCESSUS  \\nD’AFFAIRES GOUVERNEMENTAUX\\n\\nFace aux importants défis de main–d’œuvre et dans le contexte où l’administration publique doit optimiser \\n\\nla gestion de ses ressources, l’automatisation des processus s’avère essentielle pour continuer à répondre \\n\\naux attentes de la population en matière de prestation de services. Dans ce contexte, l’utilisation de l’IA offre \\n\\nune opportunité sans précédent.\\n\\nEn automatisant les tâches répétitives, l’administration publique peut libérer le personnel de l’État pour \\n\\nse concentrer sur des tâches plus stimulantes et à plus forte valeur ajoutée. En ce sens, les organismes \\n\\npublics devront accorder une importance particulière à l’automatisation des processus, notamment à l’aide \\n\\nde l’intelligence artificielle, dans le cadre de l’élaboration de leur plan de transformation numérique.\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n39\\n\\n\fOBJECTIF  6 –  \\n\\nMAXIMISER LES RETOMBÉES DES PROJETS  \\nEN RESSOURCES INFORMATIONNELLES  \\nET EN ASSURER LE SUCCÈS \\n\\nL’État québécois consacre plus de cinq milliards de dollars par année aux projets et aux activités en ressources \\n\\ninformationnelles menés par les organismes publics. En février 2024, 2 120 projets en ressources \\n\\ninformationnelles étaient considérés comme actifs au sein de l’administration publique.\\n\\nLe contexte de rareté des ressources fait en sorte que ces initiatives ne peuvent pas toutes être réalisées  \\n\\ndans les délais souhaités, ce qui peut ralentir la transformation numérique de l’État.\\n\\nL’administration publique doit disposer des conditions gagnantes qui lui permettront de livrer des projets \\n\\ntechnologiques selon les délais impartis et en fonction des ressources prévues. Cet impératif de livraison \\n\\ndoit s’accomplir par une révision des processus entourant la priorisation des projets et des investissements \\n\\nen ressources informationnelles.\\n\\nCIBLES\\n\\n2024–2025\\n\\n2025–2026\\n\\n2026–2027\\n\\n2027–2028\\n\\n100 M $\\n\\n150 M $\\n\\n200 M $\\n\\n200 M $\\n\\nIndicateur\\n\\nSomme des bénéfices quantifiables et récurrents identifiés dans les plans de matérialisation \\n\\ndes bénéfices des projets qualifiés des organismes publics ainsi que des économies récurrentes \\n\\ngénérées dans le cadre de l’offre de service du ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique\\n\\n6.1  PRIORISER LES PROJETS À L’ÉCHELLE GOUVERNEMENTALE\\n\\nPuisque le démarrage de nouvelles initiatives en ressources informationnelles est décentralisé dans chacun des \\n\\norganismes publics, les besoins auxquels elles répondent sont souvent davantage sectoriels ou ministériels que \\n\\nliés aux priorités gouvernementales.\\n\\nAinsi, dans le but d’éviter la dispersion des efforts et des ressources des organismes publics dans un trop grand \\n\\nnombre d’initiatives, un portefeuille de projets prioritaires en ressources informationnelles sera élaboré afin \\n\\nd’établir les priorités gouvernementales au regard des initiatives en transformation numérique et s’assurer que \\n\\nles actions comportant le plus de bénéfices pour les citoyennes et les citoyens et les entreprises seront priorisées.\\n\\n40\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n\f6.2  PRIORISER LES INVESTISSEMENTS EN RESSOURCES \\nINFORMATIONNELLES EN FONCTION DES BÉNÉFICES \\nFINANCIERS ET DE LA VALEUR PUBLIQUE GÉNÉRÉS\\n\\nLes sommes importantes et le nombre de ressources humaines consacrées aux projets en ressources \\n\\ninformationnelles rendent nécessaires de suivre et de mesurer les bénéfices générés par ceux–ci. Il importe \\n\\nque chaque dollar investi profite aux citoyennes et aux citoyens, que ce soit grâce aux gains en efficacité pour \\n\\nl’administration publique ou par l’amélioration directe des services reçus. À terme, une meilleure gestion des \\n\\nbénéfices dans les projets en ressources informationnelles permettra de générer davantage de valeur pour \\n\\nl’ensemble du Québec.\\n\\nC’est pour cette raison que la poursuite de la mise en application du Cadre gouvernemental de gestion des \\n\\nbénéfices des projets en ressources informationnelles13 par les organismes publics est centrale à la réalisation \\n\\nde la Stratégie 2024–2028. Les projets des organismes publics devront être priorisés en fonction des bénéfices \\n\\nfinanciers estimés et de la valeur publique escomptée.\\n\\n6.3  DÉVELOPPER ET MAINTENIR L’EXPERTISE  \\n\\nDE L’ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE DANS LES DOMAINES  \\nLIÉS AUX RESSOURCES INFORMATIONNELLES\\n\\nLa vitesse d’évolution des technologies de l’information exige de l’administration publique qu’elle reste à l’affût \\n\\nde la progression constante des compétences et des expertises qui lui permettront de se positionner à l’avant–\\n\\ngarde des opportunités offertes par le numérique et des impératifs de la cybersécurité. Les nombreux projets \\n\\nà la base des ambitions gouvernementales en matière du numérique et de la cybersécurité ne pourront être \\n\\nréalisés que si l’administration publique dispose de la main–d’œuvre et de l’expertise nécessaires. Par ailleurs, \\n\\nl’administration publique doit s’assurer de développer son expertise interne dans les domaines critiques \\n\\ndu numérique, notamment en matière de cybersécurité et d’IA.\\n\\nEn réponse à ces nombreux défis et en cohérence avec la Stratégie de gestion des ressources humaines de la fonction \\n\\npublique 2023–2028, l’administration publique devra innover en matière d’expérience employé, notamment pour \\n\\nles domaines du numérique et de la cybersécurité. C’est en faisant preuve de créativité, d’audace et de flexibilité \\n\\nque l’État pourra se positionner comme un employeur de choix dans ces domaines. Ainsi, lorsqu’un expert \\n\\ndu domaine des ressources informationnelles se cherchera un emploi, il devra sentir que son expérience, en tant \\n\\nqu’employé de l’administration publique, sera valorisante, enrichissante et qu’elle lui permettra de répondre à ses \\n\\nbesoins de développement personnel et professionnel.\\n\\nAu–delà du recrutement, les organismes publics doivent faire en sorte de développer et de maintenir \\n\\nl’expertise détenue par leur personnel en ressources informationnelles en leur offrant les moyens  \\n\\net le temps de se former de façon continue.\\n\\n 13.

Dans un contexte marqué par la rareté \\n\\nde main–d’œuvre et les capacités limitées dans plusieurs organismes publics, la mutualisation des services, des \\n\\ninfrastructures, de l’expertise et des ressources s’avère indispensable pour appuyer la cadence de la transformation \\n\\nnumérique gouvernementale tout en favorisant une synergie accrue entre les différentes entités.\\n\\nDans ce contexte, les initiatives de mutualisation telles que la mise en œuvre de fondations numériques \\n\\ngouvernementales ainsi que diverses autres initiatives tireront directement profit de cette démarche \\n\\ncollaborative. En consolidant ses efforts et en partageant efficacement les ressources, l’administration publique \\n\\nquébécoise renforcera sa capacité à relever les défis liés à la transformation numérique et, par le fait même, \\n\\nson autonomie numérique.\\n\\nCIBLES\\n\\n2024–2025\\n\\n2025–2026\\n\\n2026–2027\\n\\n2027–2028\\n\\n70 %\\n\\n80 %\\n\\n80 %\\n\\n80 %\\n\\nIndicateur\\n\\nPourcentage des nouveaux projets qualifiés en ressources \\n\\ninformationnelles ayant fait l’objet d’une analyse sur la possibilité \\n\\nde mutualiser ou de réutiliser des solutions existantes entre \\n\\nles organismes publics au cours de la phase de planification\\n\\n42\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n\f7.1  ÉTABLIR ET ASSURER LA GOUVERNANCE  \\n\\nDE LA MUTUALISATION, NOTAMMENT  \\nDES FONDATIONS NUMÉRIQUES\\n\\nPour générer les bénéfices escomptés, la mutualisation entre les organismes publics doit faire l’objet \\n\\nd’orientations claires, ainsi que d’une gouvernance établissant les rôles et responsabilités des acteurs impliqués.\\n\\nLa mise en place d’une telle gouvernance permettra notamment d’outiller et de guider les organismes publics \\n\\nen vue de l’adoption de ces nouvelles pratiques.\\n\\nLa mutualisation est une approche stratégique visant à favoriser la mise en commun de ressources, \\nd’expertises, de services, d’infrastructures ou d’activités en maximisant les avantages de la collaboration \\net de la coopération des organismes publics comme la réutilisation des infrastructures technologiques \\nexistantes ou en développement.\\n\\nLes fondations numériques gouvernementales constituent une forme de mutualisation dont l’administration \\n\\npublique doit tirer profit. Elles permettent d’accélérer la transformation numérique de l’État et de mettre \\n\\nen commun des services d’intérêt gouvernemental au bénéfice des citoyennes et des citoyens, des entreprises \\n\\net du personnel de l’État. De plus, ces fondations permettent d’assurer une uniformité dans la prestation \\n\\nde services numériques offerte par les organismes publics en fournissant des services cohérents. \\n\\nL’établissement d’un cadre cohérent des fondations numériques gouvernementales permettra le développement \\n\\nde ces dernières de façon concertée et en mettant les organismes publics à contribution.\\n\\nLes fondations numériques gouvernementales sont des plateformes ou des composants communs \\npouvant être utilisés et intégrés à même les prestations de services de l’ensemble des organismes \\npublics. Concrètement, il s’agit d’initiatives numériques à haut potentiel de réutilisation entre \\nles organismes publics, qui seront mises en place pour éviter les dédoublements dans les actifs \\ninformationnels au sein de l’administration publique.

Il est donc impératif, \\n\\npour le gouvernement du Québec et au bénéfice de l’ensemble de sa population, que ces \\n\\ninterconnexions se fassent de façon sécuritaire. Les infrastructures numériques devront assurer une \\n\\npuissance de traitement ainsi qu’une capacité de stockage sécuritaire des données sans précédent, \\n\\naméliorant les modes de production et la productivité tout en permettant de réaliser des économies. \\n\\nDévelopper des actifs favorisant l’autonomie numérique\\n\\nLa portabilité d’un actif informationnel désigne la capacité de déplacer cet actif d’une infrastructure \\n\\ninformatique à une autre sans perte de fonctionnalité ou d’intégrité. \\n\\nAfin de permettre la portabilité de ses actifs informationnels, le gouvernement veillera à instaurer des \\n\\npolitiques et des normes, lesquelles viseront à assurer sa pleine et entière autonomie numérique par \\n\\nl’accroissement de l’utilisation des technologies libres et ouvertes.\\n\\nPar exemple, grâce à la conteneurisation, un organisme public pourrait encapsuler ses logiciels dans \\n\\nun format ouvert et standardisé. Cette action simplifierait leur transfert et leur exécution entre le nuage \\n\\nexterne, le nuage gouvernemental du Québec ou encore un centre de traitement informatique tout \\n\\nen garantissant la sécurité de l’actif et l’intégralité de ses fonctionnalités.\\n\\nRappelons, au passage, que le logiciel libre ne constitue pas une fin en soi, mais plutôt un moyen \\n\\nd’obtenir notamment le contrôle d’un système technologique et d’en faciliter le partage. Ce contrôle \\n\\npermet d’assurer une certaine indépendance à l’égard des manufacturiers de logiciels, de gérer \\n\\nsainement les cycles de vie, d’augmenter la pérennité des solutions, de simplifier la mutualisation \\n\\net de consolider les investissements.\\n\\n48\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n\fPour ce faire, l’administration publique se donne les trois objectifs suivants :\\n\\nOBJECTIFS DE L’AXE III\\n\\nOBJECTIF \\n8\\nConsolider les actifs  \\ntechnologiques \\n\\nOBJECTIF \\n9\\nRésorber la désuétude  \\ndes actifs informationnels  \\nde l’administration publique\\n\\nOBJECTIF \\n10\\nSoutenir le déploiement  \\ndes infrastructures  \\nde télécommunication\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n49\\n\\n\fOBJECTIF  8 –  \\n\\nCONSOLIDER LES ACTIFS TECHNOLOGIQUES \\n\\nLa migration des systèmes technologiques des ministères et organismes publics vers l’infonuagique constitue \\n\\nun levier important pour accroître la performance et l’agilité de l’État.

L’État québécois, \\n\\nincluant les réseaux de la santé et des services sociaux, de l’éducation et de l’enseignement supérieur, \\n\\nainsi que les entreprises et les organismes privés comptent sur une connexion performante afin de  \\n\\nmieux servir leur clientèle, d’accroître leur productivité et d’augmenter leur compétitivité internationale. \\n\\nDe plus, des enjeux importants de cybersécurité sont à considérer, car les données des citoyennes, \\n\\ndes citoyens et des entreprises du Québec, ainsi que leurs communications, circulent sur ces réseaux. \\n\\nC’est pourquoi le ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique s’assurera que les réseaux et les \\n\\ninfrastructures de télécommunication, ainsi que les données qui y transitent, bénéficient de la plus \\n\\nhaute protection contre les cyberattaques. \\n\\nActuellement, le ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique est responsable d’offrir des services \\n\\nde télécommunication à la grande majorité des organismes publics ainsi qu’au réseau de la santé  \\n\\net des services sociaux, par l’intermédiaire de prestataires de services privés. Toutefois, un certain \\n\\nnombre d’entreprises du gouvernement ou d’organismes publics utilisent des réseaux distincts pour \\n\\nsoutenir leurs activités. Le ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique jouera donc un rôle actif  \\n\\npour optimiser l’utilisation de ces infrastructures, contribuer à la cohérence de leur déploiement \\n\\net permettre la mise en place des mesures visant à assurer leur sécurité. \\n\\nL’amélioration de la couverture cellulaire\\n\\nPour des raisons liées à la sécurité et à la vitalité économique des régions, l’amélioration de la qualité \\n\\ndes services cellulaires sur tout le territoire est l’objet d’efforts soutenus de l’État québécois. Ainsi, \\n\\ndes aides financières importantes sont accordées à des entreprises de télécommunication en vue \\n\\nde la construction de nouveaux sites cellulaires partout au Québec, dans des zones où la couverture \\n\\nest inexistante ou mauvaise. Ce soutien financier permet de rehausser la qualité des réseaux \\n\\net des services qu’ils rendent à leur clientèle. Le déploiement de nouveaux sites cellulaires se fait \\n\\nen s’assurant que toute possibilité de mutualisation avec des équipements du Réseau national intégré \\n\\nde radiocommunication (RENIR) est prise en considération. \\n\\nPar ailleurs, le ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique poursuivra les travaux visant le transfert \\n\\nde la desserte policière vers le RENIR et la mise à niveau de celui-ci.\\n\\n 17.

Ces travaux ont donné lieu à la création du programme \\n\\nde Réseau gouvernemental de télécommunication (RGT), dont les services remplaceront progressivement \\n\\nceux du Réseau intégré de télécommunication multimédia (RITM) qui procure actuellement des services aux \\n\\n34 établissements du réseau de la santé et des services sociaux et à près de 100 autres organismes publics.\\n\\nSous la responsabilité du ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique, le RGT offrira une gamme de services \\n\\nde pointe afin de soutenir la mise en œuvre de projets structurants tels que le Programme de consolidation \\n\\ndes centres de traitement informatique et de l’optimisation du traitement et du stockage et le virage infonuagique. \\n\\nIl a pour but l’élaboration de solutions d’affaires et technologiques soutenant la transmission de données \\n\\nde toute nature. Les services offerts permettront des transmissions sécurisées de données à haut débit tant \\n\\nfilaires que sans fil. En introduisant des technologies permettant sa virtualisation, le RGT s’affranchit un peu \\n\\nplus des infrastructures des fournisseurs privés de services de télécommunication puisque le ministère \\n\\nde la Cybersécurité et du Numérique sera propriétaire de ces équipements. \\n\\nLes organismes publics seront appelés à collaborer avec le ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique \\n\\ndans la migration des services du RITM vers le RGT en fournissant les ressources locales requises.\\n\\nCIBLES\\n\\n2024–2025\\n\\n2025–2026\\n\\n2026–2027\\n\\n2027–2028\\n\\n25 %\\n\\n65 %\\n\\n85 %\\n\\n100 %\\n\\nIndicateur\\n\\nPourcentage des services du Réseau intégré \\n\\nde télécommunication multimédia (RITM) \\n\\nayant migré vers le Réseau gouvernemental \\n\\nde télécommunication (RGT)\\n\\n56\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de cybersécurité et du numérique 2024–2028 \\n\\n\fCONCLUSION \\n\\nCette stratégie gouvernementale représente une opportunité réelle pour l’administration publique de tirer \\n\\nle meilleur du numérique, notamment pour augmenter sa performance, mais surtout améliorer son offre \\n\\nde service au bénéfice des citoyennes et des citoyens. Dans un contexte où la vie quotidienne se numérise \\n\\nde plus en plus, que ce soit par le télétravail, la télémédecine ou même la formation, les services publics doivent \\n\\nse transformer pour répondre aux attentes de la population. D’ici 2028, la mise en oeuvre de cette stratégie \\n\\npermettra de répondre à ces attentes, notamment en améliorant de façon significative l’expérience citoyenne \\n\\nà l’égard des services numériques offerts par l’administration publique. \\n\\nLes orientations proposées représentent également des opportunités pour l’optimisation des services offerts par \\n\\nl’État. Par exemple, en intégrant de façon responsable, sécuritaire et innovante des processus d’automatisation \\n\\net d’intelligence artificielle, les organismes publics seront en mesure de développer tout le potentiel \\n\\nd’optimisation et d’efficience dans leurs opérations. \\n\\nSi des services de qualité engendrent la confiance, des services sécuritaires consolident cette dernière.  \\n\\nAinsi, la transformation numérique qui se poursuivra dans les prochaines années devra se faire sur des bases \\n\\nsolides en matière de sécurité de l’information et de cybersécurité. Les services publics n’en seront que plus \\n\\ndurables et résilients. \\n\\nFinalement, même s’il existe maintenant un ministère de la Cybersécurité et du Numérique pour assurer \\n\\nle leadership de cette transformation, celle–ci doit être portée par l’ensemble des organismes publics.  \\n\\nC’est en effet collectivement que l’administration publique doit assumer la responsabilité de se transformer,  \\n\\nmais également de démontrer aux citoyennes et aux citoyens l’impact positif d’un État numérique.  \\n\\nAinsi, la collaboration entre les organismes publics est un élément clé du succès de cette transformation \\n\\npar le numérique qui se poursuit, toujours dans l’objectif de faire mieux pour les citoyennes et les citoyens \\n\\ndu Québec.\\n\\nStratégie gouvernementale de

Québec\\nGouvernement du Canada\\n\\n---\\n\\n### About the Montréal Declaration on Responsible AI\\n\\nAbout the\\nMontréal Declaration on Responsible AI\\nAn initiative of Université de Montréal\\nContext\\nOn November 3, 2017, the Université de Montréal launched the co-construction process for the Montréal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence (Montréal Declaration) . A year later, the results of these citizen deliberations are public. Dozens of events were organized to stimulate discussion on social issues that arise with artificial intelligence (AI), and 15 deliberation workshops were held over three months, involving over 500 citizens, experts and stakeholders from all backgrounds.\\nThe Montréal Declaration is a collective work that aims to put AI development at the service of the well-being of all people, and to guide social change by developing recommendations with strong democratic legitimacy.\\nThe selected citizen co-construction method is based on a preliminary declaration of general ethical principles structured around seven (7) fundamental values: well-being, autonomy, justice, privacy, knowledge, democracy and responsibility. Following the process, the Declaration was enriched and now presents 10 principles based on the following values: well-being, autonomy, intimacy and privacy, solidarity, democracy, equity, inclusion, caution, responsibility and environmental sustainability.\\nOur process for responsible artificial intelligence\\nThe Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence is based on a declaration of ethical principles built around 7 core values: well-being, autonomy, justice, privacy, knowledge, democracy and responsibility. These values, suggested by a group of ethics, law, public policy and artificial intelligence experts, have been informed by a deliberation process. This deliberation occurred through consultations held over three months, in 15 different public spaces, and sparked exchanges between over 500 citizens, experts and stakeholders from every horizon.\\nCo-construction\\nExpert perspective and citizen experience\\nfor an ethical development of AI\\nThe deliberation - Exposing, Debating, Suggesting\\nExposing\\nEducational, ethical and methodological introduction\\nWhat is artificial intelligence? What are the ethical issues raised by AI? What is co-construction, and most importantly, what is expected of citizens? The scientific co-directors of the Declaration answer these questions and set the stage for the ensuing discussions.\\nDebating\\nGroup discussions on AI issues\\nEducation, Health, Smart Cities, Justice and the Workforce are the 5 sectors around which prospective scenarios were developed. Using these scenarios set in 2025, groups of 5 to 8 people, with the help of a facilitator, discuss ethical issues.\\nSuggesting\\nFrom ethical issues to suggestions\\nUsing the issues developed for 2025, participants must now imagine recommendations to allow a responsible rollout and use of AI in Quebec.\\nEducation\\nAt one of the tables discussing education, there was talk surrounding a 2025 elementary class where AlterEgo, an AI that assists teachers, can detect children with learning disabilities and even make teaching recommendations.\\nExcerpt from the debate\\nHow long has data on the students been collected? Who has access to this data? Will the child have to live with “his profile” throughout his entire life as a student? The risk of discrimination is very real.\\nExample of a proposal\\nselected by the group\\nEveryone must understand the consequences of using data: professionals, students and parents alike. Digital literacy training is crucial.\\nSmart City\\nOne of the scenarios under the Smart City theme led to a discussion around a couple owning an appliance that prepares the week’s menu and is connected to a smart refrigerator, as well as their watches and cellphones. The data concerning their sleep, energy expenditure, amount of fat consumed, is all recorded and sent to … their health insurance provider.\\nExcerpt from the debate\\nUseful for a busy life. But the day the family decides to have burgers and fries, do their insurance premiums go up? Can the consumption data be sent to companies? Are we independent when it comes to our so-called “healthy” choices?\\nExample of a proposal\\nselected by the group\\nThe Consumer Protection Act should be updated and overhauled to avoid any conflict of interests. We must ensure that the use of data is transparent, and the user must have the right to configure connected objects.\\nHealth\\nAt one of the tables focused on health, we discussed the case of Soline, an elderly lady kept at home thanks to her robot Vigilo. This AI monitors the evolution of the patient’s dementia, prepares her pills and can even hold a conversation with her. Her family can check every interaction and every element of data at any time, which is very reassuring for them.\\nExcerpt from the debate\\nStaying at home is a priority for the patient and a plus for the healthcare system. But does entrusting a robot with her care mean that family and medical personnel are no longer responsible? And does the patient really want her family to know everything about her?\\nExample of a proposal\\nselected by the group\\nDeclaration Development Committee\\nLeader\\nMarc-Antoine Dilhac\\nScientific Co-director of the Declaration, Full Professor, Department of Philosophy, UdeM, Chair of the Ethics and Politics Group, Centre de recherche en éthique (CRÉ), Canada Research Chair in Public Ethics and Political Theory\\nCitizen Deliberation and Co-construction\\nLeader\\nChristophe Abrassart\\nScientific Co-director of the Declaration, professor in the School of design and Co-director of Lab Ville Prospective of the Faculty of Planning of the Université de Montréal, member of Centre de recherche en éthique (CRÉ)\\nAnalysis and\\nRecommendations\\nLeader\\nChristophe Abrassart\\nScientific Co-director of the Declaration, professor in the School of design and Co-director of Lab Ville Prospective of the Faculty of Planning of the Université de Montréal, member of Centre de recherche en éthique (CRÉ)\\nMarc-Antoine Dilhac\\nScientific Co-director of the Declaration, Full Professor, Department of Philosophy, UdeM, Chair of the Ethics and Politics Group, Centre de recherche en éthique (CRÉ), Canada Research Chair in Public Ethics and Political Theory\\nPascale Lehoux\\nFull Professor at the School of Public Health of University of Montreal (ESPUM); Chair on Responsible Innovation in Health\\nProcess and\\nImpact Evaluation\\nLeader\\nLise Gauvin\\nFull Professor and Dean of the School of Public Health of University of Montreal (ESPUM)\\nOur partners\\nFonds de recherche du Québec\\n\\n---\\n\\n### A Declaration\\n\\nA Declaration\\nFor what purpose?\\nThe Montréal Declaration is a collective work that aims to put AI development at the service of the well-being of all people, and to guide social change by developing recommendations with strong democratic legitimacy.\\nFor whom?\\nThe Montréal Declaration is addressed to any person, organization and company that wishes to take part in the responsible development of artificial intelligence.\\nAccording to what method?\\nThe Declaration was born from an inclusive deliberation process that initiates a dialogue between citizens, experts, public officials, industry stakeholders, civil organizations and professional associations.\\nMontréal Declaration Activity Report\\n2018 — 2022\\nOur co-construction partners\\nGouvernement du Québec\\nGouvernement du Canada\\n\\n---\\n\\n[Fetch error for mailto:?body=https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/: InvalidSchema No connection adapters were found for 'mailto:?body=https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/']\n","\n","Included URLs:\n"," - https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com\n"," - https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/about/\n"," - https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/\n"," - mailto:?body=https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. municipality_strat_responsible_AI\n","https://mtl.ged.montreal.ca/constellio/?collection=mtlca&portal=REPDOCVDM#!displayDocument/00000092887"],"metadata":{"id":"BXcZ7kajRVRw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"9x0vtNLsVA-r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# =========================================\n","# Municipality Link 2 (uploaded PDF)\n","# File (CSV out): municipality_strat_responsible_AI.csv\n","# Strict schema + low-content warning\n","# =========================================\n","\n","# -------------------------\n","# 0) Install & Mount Drive\n","# -------------------------\n","!pip -q install langdetect==1.0.9 pdfminer.six==20240706 pypdf==4.2.0\n","\n","from google.colab import drive, files  #

La \\nDéclaration de Montréal pour un développement \\nresponsable de l’intelligence artificielle a inspiré \\nplusieurs démarches similaires à travers le monde. \\nDe plus, en tant qu’un des principaux pôles \\nmondiaux en matière d’expertise en IA, Montréal \\na vu naître des découvertes fondamentales et des \\ninstitutions majeures, telles que Mila - Institut \\nquébécois d’intelligence artificielle et IVADO \\n(Institut de valorisation des données). Grâce à cet \\nenvironnement exceptionnel, la Ville de Montréal \\nbénéficie d’un contexte unique pour intégrer l’IA \\ndans ses pratiques, un atout dont peu de villes \\npeuvent se prévaloir. \\n\\nEnfin, le rapport Prêt pour l’IA, du Conseil de \\nl’innovation du Québec, présenté le 5 février 2024, \\npropose des recommandations pour encadrer \\nl’IA. Ce rapport présente 12 recommandations \\nprioritaires et 25 recommandations complémentaires \\npour assurer un développement et une utilisation \\nresponsables de cette technologie au Québec. \\nSes principales recommandations concernent \\nl’encadrement, l’anticipation, l’adaptation, la \\nformation, le rayonnement et l’évolution du domaine \\nde l’IA au Québec.\\n\\nPréambule\\n\\nIntroduction \\n\\nLa Stratégie d’intégration de l’IA de la Ville de \\nMontréal est un document clé qui présente la \\nvision de la Ville pour une utilisation responsable \\net éthique de l’IA. Cette stratégie vise également \\nà promouvoir l’innovation et la créativité, tout en \\ngarantissant la protection des droits et de la vie \\nprivée de la population montréalaise. En adoptant \\nune approche proactive et collaborative, la Ville de \\nMontréal aspire à devenir une référence en matière \\nd’utilisation éthique et responsable de l’IA, tout en \\nassurant un impact positif et durable sur la qualité \\nde vie de sa population. \\n\\nContexte \\n\\nLa mise en place et le développement de l’IA varient \\ngrandement d’un pays à l’autre. Nous nous sommes \\ninspirés des modèles des États-Unis, de l’Union \\neuropéenne ainsi que des gouvernements canadien \\net québécois pour concrétiser cette stratégie.\\n\\nL’approche américaine est basée sur le leadership \\ntechnologique et l’innovation. Elle vise à promouvoir \\nla recherche et le développement en IA, à augmenter \\nl’accès aux ressources et à en établir des normes \\npour une utilisation fiable. Avec cette approche, \\nelle espère atteindre une position de leader dans \\nle développement et l’application de l’IA, tout en \\nabordant les défis et les occasions présentés par \\ncette technologie. \\n\\nL’Union européenne (UE), de son côté, a adopté \\nune approche axée sur la gestion des risques en \\nproposant plusieurs niveaux de risques pour les \\nsystèmes IA. Cette approche plus réglementaire \\net prescriptive, qui vise à garantir les droits \\nfondamentaux des gens, la sécurité des données et \\nles principes éthiques, tout en stimulant l’innovation \\net l’investissement dans l’IA, implique toutefois \\ntransparence, traçabilité et responsabilité. L’UE vise \\nà établir un écosystème d’excellence en matière \\nd’IA, en investissant dans la recherche, l’innovation \\net le développement des compétences, tout en \\npromouvant la coopération internationale. \\n\\n4\\n\\n\fQu’est-ce que l’intelligence artificielle (IA)?\\n\\nL’IA se réfère à un domaine de l’informatique qui vise à créer des systèmes capables d’imiter ou de simuler \\nl’intelligence humaine. Cela inclut le développement de technologies et d’algorithmes permettant aux machines \\nd’apprendre à partir de données, de comprendre et d’interpréter des informations complexes, de résoudre \\ndes problèmes, de prendre des décisions, et même d’interagir de manière naturelle avec les humains. En \\n2024, l’OCDE a défini un système d’IA comme « un système basé sur l’ingénierie logicielle et/ou matérielle \\nqui, pour un ensemble donné d’objectifs définis par l’humain, génère des résultats tels que des prédictions, \\ndes recommandations ou des décisions influençant les environnements réels ou virtuels ». Cette définition met \\nl’accent sur la diversité des applications de l’IA, y compris les avancées récentes dans l’IA générative, capable \\nde créer de nouveaux contenus comme des textes, des images ou des sons. \\n\\nL’IA a des applications diverses dans des domaines tels que la médecine, la finance, l’automatisation industrielle, \\nles transports, les jeux, et bien d’autres. Son développement continue d’évoluer rapidement, entraînant toutefois \\ndes implications significatives sur la société et l’économie.\\n\\nSoulignons que de nombreux éléments clés et découvertes fondamentales dans le domaine de l’IA ont vu le jour \\nà Montréal. Cet écosystème d’innovation permet à la Ville de se positionner avantageusement et d’agir comme un \\nleader parmi les organismes publics.\\n\\nEn intégrant ces définitions et principes, la Stratégie d’intégration de l’IA de la Ville de Montréal s’assure de \\nrespecter les engagements pris selon la Charte des données numériques, garantissant ainsi que l’IA soit utilisée \\nde manière à renforcer la confiance de la population et à promouvoir un bien-être collectif durable. \\n\\n5\\n\\n\fVision\\n\\nMontréal est déjà profondément investie, grâce à son histoire culturelle riche, ses acquis en recherche et en \\ninnovation, et son dynamisme créatif. Elle célèbre son patrimoine unique, son caractère francophone et sa \\ndiversité, tout en restant ouverte sur le monde. En tant que ville où il fait bon vivre, elle aspire à attirer et \\nà rassembler ses résidents et résidentes, tout en répondant à l’urgence climatique et en favorisant la solidarité, \\nl’équité et l’inclusion pour tous et toutes. Montréal continue également à stimuler l’innovation et la créativité, \\ntout en plaçant l’humain au centre de ses préoccupations, et ce, tant pour les droits de la personne que pour la \\nqualité de vie dans ses quartiers. \\n\\nConsidérant que l’IA est un domaine technologique hautement dynamique, nous reconnaissons la nécessité \\nd’adopter une approche itérative. Celle-ci nous permettra de nous adapter à l’évolution rapide du paysage \\ntechnologique, organisationnel et social, ainsi qu’aux meilleures pratiques émergentes. L’intégration judicieuse \\nde l’IA contribuera à la transformation de l’administration publique de Montréal en un moteur d’efficacité. \\n\\nNous nous engageons à promouvoir l’innovation technologique en plaçant l’éthique, l’efficience, et la responsabilité \\nau cœur de nos actions. Notre objectif est de devenir un leader en utilisation éthique et responsable de l’IA, tout \\nen maintenant notre engagement envers la transparence, la diversité, l’inclusion, et la protection des données \\npersonnelles. En alignement avec les orientations stratégiques de Montréal 2030, l’IA doit permettre d’améliorer \\nla qualité de vie de la population, d’optimiser les services offerts, et de renforcer l’effervescence de l’écosystème \\nmontréalais en IA. \\n\\n6\\n\\n\fRaison d’être de la stratégie \\nd’intégration de l’IA de \\nla Ville de Montréal\\n\\nLa stratégie d’intégration de l’IA de la Ville de Montréal repose sur une démarche centrée sur l’éthique, \\nl’inclusion et la responsabilité. Ses principaux objectifs sont :\\n\\nRépondre aux besoins \\nde la population\\n\\nParticiper à l’écosystème \\nmontréalais de l’IA\\n\\n•  L’IA peut être utilisée pour répondre de manière \\nproactive aux besoins prioritaires de la population \\net des entreprises de Montréal, en améliorant \\nla qualité de vie et en fournissant des services \\npersonnalisés répondant à des besoins spécifiques. \\nCela inclut un accès amélioré à l’information, une \\ntransparence accrue, une meilleure inclusion et \\nune participation publique redoublée.\\n\\nInnover et améliorer \\nles services municipaux \\n\\n•  La présente stratégie vise à exploiter les \\n\\npossibilités offertes par l’IA pour améliorer \\nl’efficacité, l’efficience et l’innovation dans \\nl’administration municipale. Nous cherchons à \\nmaximiser l’utilisation des ressources publiques \\ntout en assurant des résultats optimaux pour \\nles citoyens et citoyennes. Cela inclut également \\nle partage dynamique d’informations avec les \\npartenaires, les entreprises ainsi que la population.\\n\\n•  En collaborant avec les organisations locales \\ndu domaine de l’IA, la Ville de Montréal peut \\nnon seulement stimuler l’innovation et créer \\nde nouvelles occasions économiques pour sa \\npopulation, mais aussi tirer parti de sa proximité \\navec les experts en IA sur son territoire. Cette \\nposition stratégique permet à la Ville d’aspirer à \\nse hisser parmi les leaders dans les organisations \\npubliques. Une approche proactive et collaborative, \\nbasée sur la transparence et la participation \\npublique, est essentielle pour positionner la Ville \\ncomme un leader dans l’utilisation responsable de \\ncette technologie transformatrice. \\n\\n•  L’utilisation de l’IA permet également à la Ville \\nde se préparer aux défis futurs, notamment en \\nfaisant preuve de résilience face aux changements \\nclimatiques, en réduisant la fracture numérique et \\nen offrant une participation accrue à la population, \\ncontribuant ainsi à construire la Ville de demain.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\fPrincipes directeurs\\n\\nLa stratégie d’intégration de l’IA de la Ville de Montréal repose sur des principes directeurs. Ils constituent \\nle cadre éthique et opérationnel qui guidera l’intégration de l’IA dans les activités de la Ville de Montréal, assurant \\nune utilisation responsable, transparente et bénéfique pour la population ainsi que pour le personnel de la Ville.\\n\\nCes principes directeurs sont les suivants :\\n\\nPertinence et nécessité  \\n\\nContrôle humain\\n\\nMaintenir le contrôle humain sur les décisions \\ncritiques prises par les systèmes d’IA et éviter \\nl’automatisation totale. Les outils d’IA doivent \\npermettre un contrôle humain adéquat et une \\nsupervision appropriée des résultats, afin que les \\ndécisions restent sous une responsabilité humaine.\\n\\nApprentissage \\net amélioration continue\\n\\nFavoriser un environnement d’apprentissage continu \\npour améliorer les systèmes d’IA en fonction des \\nretours d’expérience et des nouvelles données. \\nLa Ville doit rester ouverte à l’amélioration de \\nson approche en se basant sur les apprentissages \\nde l’écosystème de l’IA, et doit accompagner son \\npersonnel pour améliorer ses connaissances et \\nson efficacité.\\n\\nVigilance \\net imputabilité\\n\\nMettre en place des mécanismes de surveillance \\npour garantir que seuls les outils d’IA approuvés \\nsoient utilisés et pour détecter et corriger les erreurs \\nou les biais. Les unités d’affaires utilisant l’IA sont \\nresponsables des décisions prises à l’aide de ces \\noutils et doivent pouvoir expliquer les raisons de \\nces décisions. \\n\\nUtiliser l’IA pour répondre aux besoins prioritaires de \\nsa population, de ses organisations et entreprises, \\net améliorer les services municipaux de manière \\nsignificative. Les initiatives d’IA doivent être \\njustifiées par un besoin opérationnel spécifique, \\napporter une valeur ajoutée aux activités de la Ville \\nou s’inscrire dans un esprit de bien commun. \\n\\nÉthique et responsabilité\\n\\nAssurer que toutes les initiatives d’IA respectent \\nles normes éthiques les plus élevées et prennent en \\ncompte les implications sociétales, y compris la lutte \\ncontre les discriminations. L’utilisation de l’IA doit \\nêtre conforme aux principes éthiques et aux valeurs \\nde la Ville, en respectant les droits et la vie privée \\ndes individus concernés.  \\n\\nTransparence \\net explicabilité\\n\\nVeiller à ce que les décisions prises par les systèmes \\nd’IA soient transparentes et compréhensibles pour la \\npopulation. Le fonctionnement des modèles d’IA doit \\nêtre expliqué clairement, permettant aux utilisateurs \\net utilisatrices de comprendre les conclusions qui en \\ndécoulent. La Ville a la responsabilité de comprendre \\net de justifier les résultats et recommandations de \\nl’IA dans un langage accessible. \\n\\nSécurité \\net confidentialité\\n\\nProtéger toutes les données utilisées par les systèmes \\nd’IA en fonction de leur niveau de confidentialité et \\ngarantir la sécurité des systèmes contre les menaces. \\nCela inclut non seulement les données personnelles \\nde résidentes et résidents montréalais, mais aussi \\ntoutes les données de la Ville.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\fPerspectives offertes \\npar l’IA\\n\\nL’avènement de l’IA marque un tournant décisif pour notre ville et ses organisations. Sa démocratisation rapide \\nouvre des perspectives inédites, et il est désormais possible d’envisager son intégration dans de nombreuses \\nsphères de nos activités. L’IA représente une occasion unique de transformer la Ville de Montréal, en rehaussant \\nla qualité et l’accessibilité des services tout en renforçant notre performance organisationnelle. \\n\\nImpact sur la qualité \\ndes services \\n\\nL’IA est prête à révolutionner la manière dont nous \\ninteragissons entre nous et la population. Grâce \\nà des systèmes intelligents, nous pouvons non \\nseulement améliorer la rapidité et la précision de nos \\nréponses, mais également introduire des services \\ninnovants à travers des assistants virtuels, par \\nexemple. Ces interfaces, qu’elles soient textuelles, \\nvocales, visuelles ou vidéo, offriront une expérience \\nutilisateur renouvelée, intuitive et ergonomique.\\n\\nAmélioration de \\nla performance \\norganisationnelle \\n\\nAu-delà des services publics, l’IA promet d’optimiser \\nnos opérations internes de manière significative. \\nEn exploitant des analyses prédictives avancées et \\ndes systèmes automatisés, nous pourrons améliorer \\nnotre efficacité opérationnelle, réduire les coûts et \\noptimiser la gestion des ressources humaines et \\nmatérielles. Ces améliorations  nous permettront de \\ndevenir une administration plus agile et proactive, \\ncapable de répondre aux défis urbains avec rapidité \\net précision, en s’appuyant sur des données \\nhistoriques et des événements en temps réel. \\n\\n9\\n\\n\fL’intelligence artificielle est bien plus \\nqu’une simple avancée technologique, \\nelle est une véritable occasion de \\ntransformation pour notre ville. \\nEnsemble, saisissons cette chance de \\nbâtir un Montréal plus connecté, plus \\nintelligent et plus humain.\\n\\nExemples\\n\\nMobilité urbaine : Développement de systèmes de \\ngestion de transport intelligents pour réduire les zones \\nde congestion et améliorer la fluidité des réseaux. \\n\\nSécurité publique : Classification préventive des \\ndifférents événements :\\n\\n - Agir en amont sur les aléas climatiques pour \\ndiminuer les impacts sur la population (ex. : \\nprioriser les efforts dans les zones plus à risque).\\n\\n - Prioriser les inspections des bâtiments à risque \\n\\nafin de réduire le nombre d’incendies. \\n\\n - Permettre une distribution dynamique des \\n\\neffectifs policiers sur le territoire.\\n\\nEnvironnement : Mise en œuvre de solutions \\nbasées sur l’IA afin de mieux protéger notre \\nécosystème urbain (ex. : réduire des îlots de chaleur, \\ndiminuer l’impact des événements tels que l’agrile \\ndu frêne, etc.)\\n\\nUrbanisme : L’IA peut également optimiser la \\nconception de nos aménagements urbains en \\nfonction des aléas climatiques et des données \\nsociologiques, rendant la Ville plus résiliente aux \\nchangements futurs. \\n\\nGestion de l’eau : Identification proactive des fuites \\ndans les réseaux de distribution d’eau en analysant \\nles variations de pression et de débit. Cela permettra \\nde réparer rapidement les fuites et de minimiser les \\npertes d’eau, contribuant ainsi à une gestion plus \\nefficace de cette ressource précieuse. \\n\\nCrise du logement : En analysant les données \\ndu marché immobilier, l’IA permet d’identifier les \\ntendances, d’optimiser la planification urbaine et \\nd’assurer une allocation efficace des ressources \\npour la construction et la rénovation, aidant ainsi à \\nrépondre à la demande croissante et à soutenir les \\nlocataires vulnérables. \\n\\n10\\n\\n\fRisques et défis \\n\\nL’utilisation des outils d’IA soulève des risques et des défis importants que la Ville de Montréal doit gérer \\nadéquatement. Les services et les secteurs qui ont recours à l’IA doivent prendre en considération les \\nrisques suivants et mettre en place des mesures d’atténuation : \\n\\nUtilisation non contrôlée\\n\\nL’IA est maintenant omniprésente dans une panoplie \\nd’outils et de plateformes externes, son utilisation \\nest difficile à contrôler. Dans ce contexte, un risque \\nd’utilisation non approprié persiste.\\n\\nBiais dans les résultats \\ndes outils d’IA\\n\\nLes outils d’IA peuvent être sujets à des biais dans \\nleurs résultats, ce qui pourrait entraîner des décisions \\ndiscriminatoires ou inéquitables pour certains \\ngroupes de la population, renforçant ainsi les \\ndiscriminations systémiques. \\n\\nDépendance envers les \\nfournisseurs externes  \\nL’utilisation d’outils d’IA externes pourrait créer une \\ndépendance envers les fournisseurs, limitant ainsi \\nle contrôle de la Ville sur ses propres processus et \\ndonnées et compromettant la résilience de la Ville.\\n\\nQualité et fiabilité \\ndes résultats \\n\\nLa qualité et la fiabilité des résultats produits par les \\noutils d’IA peuvent varier. Cela pourrait entraîner des \\ndécisions erronées ou incohérentes qui pourraient \\naffecter négativement les services publics. \\n\\nSécurité et confidentialité \\ndes données \\n\\nInfluence sur les processus \\ndémocratiques\\n\\nNous reconnaissons les risques relatifs à la sécurité \\net à la confidentialité des données, même lorsque \\nl’IA est utilisée à des fins internes. Nous mettrons en \\nplace des mesures de sécurité robustes pour atténuer \\ntout risque pouvant compromettre la protection des \\ndonnées sensibles.\\n\\nL’utilisation de l’IA dans les processus décisionnels \\npourrait créer des dépendances et des incohérences \\ndans le processus démocratique, créant ainsi de \\npotentielles conséquences néfastes pour la démocratie \\net l’intégrité des processus démocratiques.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\fCette liste qui présente les principaux \\nrisques et défis actuels évoluera \\ncertainement au fil du temps. Des mesures \\nd’atténuation spécifiques doivent être \\nmises en place pour contrer chacun de \\nces risques afin de garantir une utilisation \\nsécurisée, équitable et responsable des \\noutils d’IA par la Ville de Montréal.\\n\\nPlagiat et droits d’auteur\\n\\nL’utilisation de l’IA générative peut entraîner du \\nplagiat ou une violation des droits d’auteur si les \\ncontenus générés sont utilisés sans une autorisation \\nappropriée ou sans attribution.\\n\\nDéfis écologiques \\net environnementaux\\n\\nL’utilisation intensive des systèmes d’IA peut \\nentraîner une consommation énergétique élevée, \\naugmentant l’empreinte carbone de la Ville et \\ncontribuant aux impacts environnementaux \\nnégatifs1.\\n\\nFracture numérique \\n\\nL’intégration de l’IA pourrait accentuer la fracture \\nnumérique, tant au sein de l’administration que \\nparmi la population, sans des initiatives adéquates \\nde littératie numérique et d’inclusion technologique. \\n\\n1.  Cependant, l’IA peut également optimiser l’utilisation des ressources énergétiques et réduire l’empreinte carbone de la Ville. Par exemple, les outils d’IA peuvent \\n\\naméliorer l’efficacité énergétique des infrastructures urbaines, optimiser le transport en commun et ainsi réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, et permettre \\nune gestion plus efficace des déchets. Avec le soutien du milieu de la recherche, ces empreintes écologiques peuvent aujourd’hui être calculées avec une précision \\naccrue, permettant ainsi des interventions plus ciblées et efficaces pour diminuer l’impact environnemental de la Ville.\\n\\n12\\n\\n\fObjectifs \\nstratégiques \\n\\nLes objectifs stratégiques visent à soupeser les risques et les défis décrits à la section précédente. Ces objectifs \\nsont centrés sur une intégration responsable, équitable et inclusive de l’IA dans nos services municipaux. Nous \\ncomptons identifier les domaines où l’IA peut optimiser notre efficacité et offrir de nouvelles possibilités, tout \\nen respectant les principes de la Déclaration de Montréal pour un développement responsable de l’intelligence \\nartificielle. Cette approche proactive nécessite la mise en place de projets pilotes, l’évaluation de leur impact sur \\nla population et nos opérations municipales, ainsi que l’élaboration de lignes directrices assurant une utilisation \\ntransparente et éthique de l’IA dans l’ensemble de nos services. Voici donc les objectifs stratégiques de cette \\ndémarche : \\n\\n2.

Améliorer la capacité \\n\\nd’adaptation de la Ville \\nface aux changements \\nrapides engendrés par l’IA\\n\\n•  En plus de s’appuyer sur l’infrastructure et \\n\\nl’ensemble de données existantes pour contrôler \\nl’utilisation de l’IA, il est essentiel que la Ville \\nde Montréal améliore sa capacité d’adaptation \\naux changements technologiques rapides. Une \\nadaptation agile permettra à la Ville de s’ajuster \\nà l’évolution constante des outils et assurera \\nune intégration harmonieuse et bénéfique à \\nl’ensemble de la communauté. \\n\\nNote : De plus larges efforts visant à améliorer la qualité et l’utilisabilité des données de la Ville (une base essentielle \\npour l’utilisation de l’IA) ne sont pas couverts dans ce document, mais font l’objet de démarches parallèles. On pense, \\nnotamment à Charte des données numériques et tout ce qui concerne la gouvernance de données.\\n\\n14\\n\\n\fAxes d’intégration \\nde l’IA à la Ville\\n\\nPour appuyer sa vision et renforcer son engagement envers la Déclaration de Montréal pour un développement \\nresponsable de l’intelligence artificielle, la Ville propose les axes structurants suivants dans la mise en œuvre \\nde sa stratégie :  \\n\\n1.

The \\nCharter, which sets out a \\nnumber of ethical principles, \\naims to ensure sound, \\naccountable and efficient \\nmanagement of the city’s data.\\n\\nIn a context of digital \\ntransformation, where \\ntechnologies are omnipresent \\nin all spheres of daily life, we \\nas a public administration \\nmust seize the opportunities \\n\\nthey offer, while ensuring that they are used \\nresponsibly. Data plays a key role in cities’ ability \\nto respond to the many challenges they face. \\nHowever, the emergence and proliferation of new \\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence, has \\nprompted us to take a critical look at data.\\n\\nDigital technology is not an end in itself, but rather \\na means of improving public services and quality \\nof life. Given the risks and concerns surrounding \\nthe deployment of new technologies, it is more \\nessential than ever to set out guidelines for data-\\nrelated practices. The increasing use of data in \\nmanagement and decision-making means that we \\nneed to specify the ways in which data is managed \\nand regulated throughout its life cycle. By clarifying \\nthe commitments that the city has made to ensure \\nthat the use of digital data promotes progress, the \\nCharter aims to limit the risks of malicious practices. \\n\\nThe city adopted the Charter in order to present a \\nclear vision for data management, one that ensures \\nthe protection of individual rights and contributes to \\nthe common good and inclusive development of the \\nMontréal territory. \\n\\nThe first version of the Digital Data Charter was \\nrevised following a consultation process. We are \\nconvinced that this updated version will fuel the \\ndevelopment of the metropolis even more, by \\npromoting ethical data management for all actors \\nin the territory. That is why we view it as a reference \\ndocument that encourages all individuals and \\norganizations working in the data environment to \\nfollow its principles.\\n\\nI extend my sincere thanks to everyone who \\ncontributed to the realization of this tool, which is \\nessential for the social and economic development \\nof our community. \\n\\nI hope you find the Charter interesting and \\ninformative to read.\\n\\nMagda Popeanu \\nMember of the Executive Committee \\nresponsible for organizational performance, \\ncitizen participation and democracy\\n\\nÉPICERIE\\n\\n4\\n\\n\fDeclaration of principles\\n\\nThe growing use of digital data in management and \\ndecision-making within public administrations has \\nled Montréal to describe and clarify the methods \\nfor regulating and controlling the life cycle of digital \\ndata. Data helps inform individual and collective \\ndecision-making. It thus potentially improves \\nurban living environments. However, when used \\nimproperly, data can also impinge on individual \\nor collective freedom by multiplying surveillance \\ntools, maximizing control mechanisms and allowing \\ninformation to be manipulated.\\n\\nMontréal developed its Digital Data Charter to seize \\nthe opportunity to strengthen the transparency, \\naccountability and efficiency of its digital data \\nmanagement.\\n\\nThis charter promotes ethical data production and \\nresponsible data management and use. It addresses \\nthe governance of digital data through its life cycle, \\nensuring that all stages are taken into account. The \\nCharter aims to encourage the advancement and \\nenhancement of data use, while preventing the risks \\nof abuse or malicious practices. \\n\\nWe invite our partners and all stakeholders \\ninvolved in the city’s economic, social and territorial \\ndevelopment of the city to follow these principles \\nand commitments, which provide an opportunity \\nto reaffirm our trustful relationship with the entire \\nMontréal community. \\n\\nThe Charter is made up of 13 principles that are \\nexpressed in the form of three commitments:\\n\\n1.  Protect human \\nrights in the \\ndigital era\\n\\n2.  Promote the general \\n\\n3.  Build a brighter \\n\\ninterest and the \\ncommon good\\n\\nfuture through data\\n\\n5\\n\\n\fProtect human \\nrights in the \\ndigital era \\n\\nAll individual rights remain \\n\\nprotected in the digital space, \\n\\nparticularly those related to privacy.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\f\f1.  Right to privacy\\n\\nPreserving privacy \\nand preventing surveillance\\n\\nThe deployment of connected urban infrastructures, \\nthe emergence of artificial intelligence and innovation \\nin massive data processing tools are increasing the \\npossibilities of individual and collective traceability. To \\nlower the risk of a smart city becoming a surveillance \\nterritory, a political, legal and ethical framework is \\nindispensable. Every effort will be made to ensure \\nthat technical devices enrich the democratic universe \\nrather than further commercial or strictly public safety \\ngoals. More specifically, the city undertakes to remain \\nvigilant regarding the deployment of any technology \\nincluding functions enabling the identification, location \\nor profiling of an individual, such as sensors or \\ncameras. The use of these technologies is therefore \\ncontrolled, and the principles of inclusive public \\nparticipation are applied in all discussions. The city \\nalso bans the collection of biometric data, including \\nfacial recognition without consent, by entities under \\nthe responsibility of municipal political bodies.\\n\\n2.  Inclusion\\n\\nEnsuring equity \\nand combating discrimination \\n\\nMontréal is firmly committed to combating all forms \\nof racism and systemic discrimination. Recognizing \\nthat in some cases, data and its uses can contribute \\nto exacerbating existing inequalities, the city \\nundertakes to use all means at its disposal to \\nensure that data does not induce a bias that could \\nlead to the exclusion or stigmatization of part of \\nthe population or individuals, particularly those \\nexperiencing multiple forms of discrimination.  \\n\\nIntersectional gender-based analysis (GBA+) is an \\nindispensable tool for shaping an inclusive city in the \\ndigital age. The city is committed to integrating the \\napplication of GBA+ in the collection, processing and \\ndissemination of its data. By taking into account the \\ndiverse needs of the population and the different \\nforms of discrimination, this approach makes it \\npossible to identify and avoid possible biases and \\nblind spots, as well as to implement specific practices \\nto counter them. Although GBA+ advocates the \\ncollection of disaggregated data, this must be done \\n\\n8\\n\\nIn addition, where appropriate, anonymization \\ntechniques are applied as early as possible in the \\ndata production cycle. As tools and systems evolve, \\nso does the ability to re-identify. To ensure that \\nwe keep pace with technological and legislative \\nadvances, we are committed to re-evaluating and \\nimproving our anonymization and risk assessment \\napproaches in line with best practice. To support this \\napproach, we are also committed to publishing a list \\nof the data capture tools that Montréal deploys in \\nthe public domain, including the rationale for and the \\nprocessing techniques applied to the data collected \\n(e.g. anonymization techniques). \\n\\nwhile protecting the right to privacy and respecting \\nthe individual’s choice to self-identify (or not).  \\n\\nIt is equally necessary to ensure that the use of data \\nby an apparently neutral software or algorithm does \\nnot induce bias, particularly when the data is used \\nas a training base for an algorithm. Thus, to limit the \\npossibility of algorithmic discrimination, the city is \\ncommitted to maintaining human control over critical \\ndecisions made by artificial intelligence systems. \\nWe prohibit decision-making based exclusively on \\nautomated processing of personal information. We \\nalso emphasize the importance of ensuring the \\nquality and traceability of the data entrusted to us, \\nso as to be able to report on the results obtained.  \\n\\n\fThe city is also committed to following best practices \\nto ensure the resilience of its information systems and \\ncritical municipal infrastructure.\\n\\nMoreover, the city opts for data hosting in Canada. \\nIt has a duty to ensure that the jurisdiction where \\npersonal information will be stored has legislation at \\nleast as strong as that of Québec with regard to the \\nprotection of personal information.\\n\\nWithdrawal of consent or deletion of data is not \\npossible for certain data that a municipality needs \\nto carry out its functions. In cases where it is not \\npossible to obtain or withdraw consent, the city will \\ndeploy its processes in line with the principles of \\nprivacy, public participation and transparency set \\nout in this document.  \\n\\n3.  Cybersecurity\\n\\nProtecting personal information \\n\\nProtecting personal information is a legal obligation \\nthat aims to protect privacy. We commit to determine \\nand implement the necessary means to protect \\ndata according to its level of confidentiality and to \\npreserve its integrity throughout its life cycle, in \\norder to minimize the risk of intrusion, loss, alteration \\nor disclosure of data. This protection is ensured, \\namong other things, by implementing controls \\nto reinforce the security of personal information, \\nand by enhancing the maturity of processes and \\nmethods for preventing, detecting and responding to \\ncybersecurity incidents. \\n\\n4. Consent \\n\\nPromoting citizen control \\nover their digital footprint\\n\\nAnyone who interacts with the city may be required \\nto provide certain information in exchange for \\nthe services requested. When collecting personal \\ninformation, as required by law, we must clearly \\nspecify the scope of the intended use and obtain \\nexplicit, voluntary and informed consent for such use. \\n\\nThe city is committed to putting in place the \\nnecessary mechanisms to understand and better \\ncontrol the sharing of individuals’ personal \\ninformation, for example by offering a list of data \\ncollected from the individual and its intended uses \\nwithin their user accounts. These mechanisms \\nmust enable individuals to exercise their right to \\nbe forgotten, i.e. the ability to request that data \\nprovided be modified or deleted. They may also \\nrevoke their consent, even if this means that they \\ncan no longer receive certain services.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\f5. Digital Sobriety \\n\\nStriving for reasoned \\nand reasonable use of data \\n\\nThe evolution of data collection and processing \\ntechnology is increasing the possibilities of data \\ngeneration. Data must be collected for specific, \\nexplicit and legitimate purposes. The legal framework \\nstipulates that all collection of personal information \\nis limited to that which is strictly necessary for the \\nprovision of a particular service. Such information \\ncannot and must not be further processed in a \\nmanner incompatible with these purposes without \\nthe explicit consent of the person concerned. \\n\\nDigital sobriety implies a commitment to collect only \\nthe data necessary and sufficient for the established \\npurpose of fulfilling our public service mission. It \\nis also a commitment to consider the life cycle of \\ndata, to limit data storage and to apply retention \\nrules governed by city directives. This includes \\ndocumenting the rationale for each data set and its \\nretention rules in a data catalogue.  \\n\\n10\\n\\n\fPromote \\nthe general \\ninterest and the \\ncommon good \\n\\nData is managed as a common \\n\\ngood, where the general interest \\n\\noutweighs the particular interest.  \\n\\n2\\n\\n\f\f6.  Common good \\n\\nGoverning data on behalf \\nof the community\\n\\nAs a public organization, Montréal collects data \\nin the interest and on behalf of its population. As \\nsuch, it becomes the trustee of these valuable digital \\nassets, and is responsible for ensuring their sound \\nmanagement in accordance with the ethical principles, \\nlaws and by-laws in force. We are committed to \\nimplementing data governance that regulates the \\nentire data life cycle in order to maximize the impact \\nof data on organizational efficiency and multiply the \\nopportunities for its use, both within the organization \\nand by the Montréal community.\\n\\n7. Digital sovereignty \\n\\nEncouraging the sharing of data \\nof general interest\\n\\nWhether as a producer or collector, the city must \\nensure that it controls the data related to its \\nterritorial jurisdictions. To promote the common \\ngood, the data of certain public or private players \\ncould thus be declared to be of general interest \\nand should be shared with the city. To facilitate this \\nsharing, we undertake to define clear and concerted \\nframeworks for dialogue and application with\\n\\nThe city defines the distribution of roles and \\nresponsibilities for access to and use of data. It \\nhas also adopted an Open Data Policy in which \\nit commits to make all its data available, under a \\nuser license that allows a wide range of uses, by \\nimplementing the means deemed necessary to \\nprotect the right to privacy, and by prioritizing the \\npublication of data to maximize its usefulness and \\nimpact for the community. \\n\\nthe stakeholders, with respect for human rights and \\nin the interest of inclusive territorial planning. The \\nsharing of data of general interest must not, however, \\nimpinge on fundamental rights such as privacy and \\nregulations governing public safety, intellectual \\nproperty and industrial secrecy.  \\n\\n13\\n\\n\f8.  Data interoperability\\n\\nPromoting data exchange, use \\nand technological neutrality\\n\\nData valorization is achieved through analysis \\nprocesses in which data is shared and combined \\nwith other data. These processes are simplified \\nby data interoperability, which characterizes data \\nthat can be used, manipulated and processed by \\ndifferent systems, with a minimum of preliminary \\nprocessing steps.\\n\\nTo make these data interoperable, we favour the \\nuse of open formats and avoid those offered by a \\nparticular technology owner.\\n\\n9.  Transparency\\n\\nForging a bond of trust \\n\\nAccess to municipal data contributes to building \\npublic trust in the municipal administration by \\ncreating a space for fact-based exchange. To \\nestablish such a bond of trust, Montréal has adopted \\nan Open Data Policy to formalize its commitments \\nto open data and to set out the rights to access this \\ndata. The principle of transparency covers a set of \\napproaches and accountability mechanisms aimed \\nat sharing not only the data collected, but also how \\nit is used, including the use of algorithms.\\n\\nTo strengthen this bond of trust, the city is committed \\nto ensuring transparent data management and \\nto implementing tools that enable the entire data \\nlife cycle to be monitored in a way that can be \\nunderstood by the public. Data management and \\nprocessing practices must be documented and made \\n\\nWe are also committed to facilitating the \\nunderstanding of data content and structure by \\nusing standardized descriptions and adopting \\nrecognized norms and standards whenever possible. \\nIn addition, the city is committed to putting in place \\nprocurement processes that ensure full control over \\nour data by requiring, among other things, access \\nto raw data in open formats, and by encouraging \\nthe acquisition or development of open-source \\nsolutions, within the framework of a policy. \\n\\npublic, including the inventory of data collected. The \\nuse made of this data, including as part of decision-\\nmaking, must also be communicated. In addition to \\npursuing this approach, the city commits to report \\npublicly on the progress made in implementing the \\nprinciples set out in this document.  \\n\\n14\\n\\n\fBuild a brighter \\nfuture through \\ndata\\n\\nLeveraging data to shape a resilient, \\n\\ninclusive and equitable city. \\n\\n3\\n\\n\f\f10.  Ecological transition \\n\\nLimiting environmental impact \\nand using data to serve the \\necological transition \\n\\nAlthough information technologies represent a \\nlever for the emergence of new solutions for the \\necological transition, the environmental impact \\ndue to the volume of digital data is significant. The \\ncity is committed to assessing these impacts and \\ncontrolling them according to usage. To this end, \\nit promotes eco-responsible data management by \\nestablishing and applying conservation rules to \\nlimit the volume of data stored. Across its territory, \\nthe city promotes sustainable data management \\nthrough its public policies, responsible procurement \\nprocesses, as well as its collaborations, in order to \\nempower stakeholders and transform practices. \\nThe city encourages the maturity of the digital \\nsustainability market and favours the emergence\\n\\n11. Universal access \\n\\nBridging the digital divide \\nand promoting equitable \\naccess to data \\n\\nEveryone has the right to fair treatment, including \\nfair access to digital data and the opportunities and \\nservices they generate. Nevertheless, inequalities \\npersist in terms of access to digital content and tools, \\nexacerbated by various factors. These include access \\nto computer equipment and an Internet connection. \\nThere is also the level of digital literacy, which \\ndirectly influences people’s interest in using data \\nand their abilities to do so. The city wants to ensure \\nthat the population and local stakeholders have the \\nmeans and tools to access data and benefit from \\nthis shared asset. We are committed to deploying \\ndecisive levers to develop accessibility and digital \\nliteracy around municipal data. \\n\\nof solutions that minimize the environmental \\nfootprint of information technologies. \\n\\nWith a view to achieving a carbon-neutral objective, \\nthe city aims to propel the opportunities offered by \\ndata to accelerate the adaptations required for the \\necological transition. Together with the Montréal \\ncommunity and stakeholders, we want to use data \\nas a means of action and accountability. Reliable \\ndata can be used to measure the impact of our \\nactivities, raise awareness of environmental issues \\nor create decision-making tools that encourage the \\nadoption of ecological behaviours, on an individual \\nor collective scale.\\n\\nFirst, it is essential to make data more accessible \\nto current and potential users, by raising digital \\naccessibility standards to enable everyone, including \\npeople with functional limitations, to access digital \\ncontent and tools. In addition to improving the \\nuniversal accessibility of digital services, we ensure \\nthat data of interest to the community is available \\nand documented, to make it easier for users to find \\nand understand. For example, offering digital skills \\ndevelopment to the community and deploying \\nexplanatory resources can make data easier to \\nunderstand and encourage its use in Montréal life.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\f12.  Public participation \\n\\nOpening dialogue \\nand involving the community\\n\\nThe city recognizes that the ongoing evolution of \\ndigital technology is creating new situations for \\nwhich guidelines are needed. We propose concerted \\ndecision-making on the responsible collection and \\nprocessing of data, by opening dialogue with the \\ncommunity. Montréal is committed to putting in \\nplace consultative and deliberative mechanisms that \\nfavour the inclusion of representatives of civil society, \\n\\nto enable collective decision-making around data. \\nRecognizing that data and related ethical issues are \\noften complex and sensitive subjects, it is essential \\nto mobilize the Montréal community so that the \\npopulation has the opportunity to contribute to \\npublic reflections surrounding digital data, paying \\nparticular attention to groups and individuals living \\nat the crossroads of discrimination. \\n\\n13. Innovation\\n\\nImagining collectively with data\\n\\nThe principle of innovation refers to the possibility \\nof imagining new ways of using data and digital \\ntools to meet current and future societal challenges. \\nData can be used to create new decision-making \\ntools, improve the delivery of public services or \\nfacilitate the transformation of practices. To this end, \\nwe are committed to strengthening the innovative \\ncapacity of the community backed by digital data, \\nby supporting exchange spaces and initiatives such \\nas hackathons and co-creation workshops, which rely\\n\\non the engagement of stakeholders around \\ntargeted issues. In its approach to innovation and \\nexperimentation, the city values a human-centered \\napproach that enables the ethical and reasoned \\nuse of data, supported by validation and control \\nmechanisms. \\n\\n18\\n\\n\fConclusion \\n\\nThe Digital Data Charter is the result of a vast \\ncollaborative effort guided by the conviction that \\ndigital data is an important driver of progress,  \\nand that its role in shaping the city of tomorrow \\nshould not be underestimated. This document \\naffirms that digital data must be managed at all \\nstages of its life cycle, given its great value to the \\nMontréal community.\\n\\nWe are committed to operationalizing this charter \\nthrough municipal mechanisms such as action plans \\nand policies, and by acting as an ambassador for \\nresponsible and sustainable data management \\nin communities. We also invite our partners to \\nadopt these commitments in order to promote \\nthe implementation of the charter’s principles \\nthroughout the Montréal territory. \\n\\nFor more information on the initiatives already in place \\nin Montréal or to which the city adheres to:\\n\\n•  Montréal 2030\\n\\n•  2020-2030 Climate Plan\\n\\n•  GBA+ Application Guide (in French)\\n\\n•  Local and responsible purchasing statement \\n\\n(in French) \\n\\n•  Open Data Policy\\n\\n•  Open Data Usage Licence (in French)\\n\\n•  Data Governance Directive\\n\\n•  Directive on the Governance of Personal Information\\n\\n•  Policy on the use and development of free \\n\\nsoftware and hardware (in French)\\n\\n•  Montréal Declaration on Responsible AI\\n\\n•  Cities Coalition for Digital Rights\\n\\n•  Act respecting access to documents held by public \\nbodies and the protection of personal information  \\n\\nFor more information on the charter and the various data-related initiatives at the city, write to us at: \\ndonneesouvertes@montreal.ca\\n\\nÉPICERIE\\n\\n19\\n\\n\fGlossary\\n\\nAnonymization \\nA technical procedure that consists of changing \\nthe content or structure of data to ensure that all \\ninformation of a sensitive nature or that allows a \\nperson to be identified is deleted or modified. This \\nprocedure makes it impossible to re-identify natural \\nor legal persons, while retaining the meaning of the \\ndata such that it can be used for specific purposes. \\n\\nBiometric data \\nInformation on physical characteristics specific \\nto an individual. There are three main categories \\nof biometrics:\\n\\n•  Morphological, based on the identification of \\nparticular physical traits (including fingerprint, \\nhand geometry, facial, retina and iris recognition);\\n\\n•  Behavioural, based on the analysis of a person’s \\nbehaviour (such as signature, voice print, gait \\nor typing style);\\n\\n•  Biological, based on the analysis of biological \\nsamples (such as DNA, blood, saliva, urine, \\nand odours).\\n\\nConnected urban infrastructures \\nRefers to sensors and other connected urban assets \\nassociated with the Internet of Things (IoT) allowing \\ninformation to be quickly collected from the field. \\nConnected objects deployed in public spaces (e.g. \\ntraffic lights, bike counters, air and water quality \\nsensors) can be used to support and improve \\nmunicipal operations and services.\\n\\nConsent  \\nFree, explicit and informed expression of will by \\nwhich an individual agrees to the collection and \\nprocessing of personal data concerning him/her. \\n\\n•  Free: implying a real choice and given without \\n\\nconstraints or undue pressure; \\n\\n•  Explicit: Consent must be obvious, certain \\n\\nand unequivocal, leaving no doubt about the \\nexpressed intent of the person concerned; \\n\\n•  Informed: Precise, given with full knowledge of \\nthe facts and with all the information needed to \\nunderstand the scope of the consent; \\n\\n•  Specific: Given for a precise, clearly defined \\n\\npurpose; \\n\\n•  Temporary: Valid only for the time required to \\n\\nachieve the purpose for which it was requested; \\n\\n•  Granular: Requested for each specific purpose; \\n\\n•  Understandable: Requested in clear, simple terms; \\n\\n•  Distinct: Requested separately from any other \\n\\ninformation, when the request is made in writing.\\n\\nConsultative and deliberative mechanisms \\nInclusive public engagement process by which a \\ngroup receives and exchanges information, critically \\nexamines an issue and reaches an agreement that \\nwill guide decision-making.\\n\\nData life cycle \\nA process that describes the major activities and \\nskills required for sound data management. The \\ndata life cycle is inspired by document management, \\nand helps to clarify concepts drawn from the \\nmanagement of similar physical assets. It includes \\npreparation (planning and classification), operation \\n(acquisition, analysis, use and distribution) and \\nend-of-life (destruction and archiving) activities.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\fData of general interest \\nData that serves the interests of the public good \\nand thus the community in the municipal context. \\nTo promote this collective good, data of general \\ninterest is shared with the territorial administration \\nin a framework that respects the rights of all to allow \\npublic administrations to assume their respective \\nsovereignty or, conversely, to allow third parties to \\ndepart from or limit the application of these powers. \\n\\nDigital accessibility  \\nDigital accessibility refers to a set of standards, \\nrules and practices that aim to make digital content \\nand tools accessible to anyone, regardless of their \\nphysical, sensory or cognitive disabilities.\\n\\nDigital divide  \\nDisparity within the population regarding access \\nto digital technologies, whether due to a lack of \\nequipment and services, or a lack of knowledge and \\nunderstanding of these technologies.\\n\\nDigital literacy  \\nAbility to understand and use digital communication \\ntechnologies, including digital data, in everyday \\nlife to achieve personal goals and expand one’s \\nknowledge and abilities. \\n\\nDigital sustainability  \\nAn approach that fosters the emergence of data and \\nsolutions that can: \\n\\n•  Minimize the environmental footprint of \\n\\ninformation technologies;\\n\\n•  Harness data to facilitate the ecological transition; \\n\\n•  Develop low-data-intensive technologies.\\n\\nDigital sobriety  \\nPhilosophy that supports the collection and storage \\nof only the necessary and sufficient data for a \\nspecific period of time. This approach contrasts with \\ncompulsive data storage, motivated by the possibility \\nthat a use for the data will be found later. Note that \\nregarding personal information, digital sobriety is a \\nlegal obligation.\\n\\nDiscrimination  \\nDistinction, exclusion, preference or treatment \\nof a person or social group in a negative way. \\nThis treatment is based on perceived or assumed \\nmembership in different social groups and on \\ndifferent grounds. Such treatment may be conscious \\nor unconscious. According to the Quebec Charter \\nof Human Rights and Freedoms, these grounds \\nmay include sex, sexual orientation, age (except as \\nprovided by law), handicap, colour, language, ethnic \\nor national origin, pregnancy, civil status, religion, \\npolitical convictions and social condition.  \\n\\nSeveral grounds for discrimination can combine to \\nmultiply the effects of exclusion. Discrimination can \\ntake a variety of forms. It can be direct (overt and \\nacknowledged) or indirect (generally without the \\nintention to discriminate).\\n\\nFacial recognition \\nPersonal identification based on facial image \\nanalysis (streaming or static).  \\n\\nFair treatment  \\nRecognition of the existence of different realities \\nand the desire to provide the same opportunities \\nfor access, use and sharing of digital data and the \\npossibilities and services it generates. \\n\\nGender-based analysis from an intersectional \\nperspective (ADS+)  \\nGender-based analysis from an intersectional \\nperspective (GBA+) is both a process and a tool \\nfor taking into account people’s particular realities \\nand needs when implementing initiatives. GBA+ \\npreventively discerns the distinct effects on women \\nand men that the adoption of a project aimed at \\nresidents may have, based on the differentiated \\nrealities and needs of women and men.\\n\\nThe + refers to the concept of intersectionality, i.e. \\nsituations where several grounds for discrimination, \\nsuch as age, sex, gender identity, social conditions, \\nreligion, skin colour or race, combine to multiply the \\neffects of exclusion.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\fIndividual traceability  \\nThe ability to follow an individual’s movements \\ndirectly or indirectly, in real time or after the fact, \\nwhich can lead to identification of the person, and \\nthus to surveillance.\\n\\nInformation system  \\nA set of resources (physical and software, \\ntechnological or application) allowing the collection, \\nstorage, manipulation and processing of data to \\nsupport an organization’s activities.\\n\\nInteroperability  \\nThe ability of data to be used, manipulated and \\nprocessed by different information systems by \\nminimizing preprocessing. \\n\\nOpen data  \\nData made available free of charge to the public \\nunder an open license. Open data is meant to be \\neasily accessible and available in open formats. \\n\\nPersonal information \\nInformation relating to a natural person and that \\ndirectly or indirectly allows that person to be \\nidentified. Personal information is confidential. Its \\nconfidentiality derives from the right to privacy, \\nwhich enables every individual to exercise control \\nover the use and circulation of his or her information.\\n\\nTechnological neutrality   \\nAchieving independence vis-a-vis tools, platforms \\nor technology providers, which implies choosing \\nsuppliers freely, as opposed to being locked to a \\nparticular technology supplier. \\n\\nTechnology with identification functions  \\nTechnology that includes an identification function \\nallows an individual to be identified when it is able \\nto distinguish him or her from another person. \\nExamples include facial recognition or radio \\nfrequency identification technology.\\n\\nTechnology with location functions   \\nTechnology that includes a location function \\nindicates where a person is at a given time. The \\ndegree of localization is variable. It can be a precise \\naddress, an approximate location, a neighbourhood, \\nor a city. GPS technology is one example.\\n\\nTechnology with profiling functions  \\nTechnology with profiling functions  refers to the \\ncollection and use of personal information to \\nevaluate and analyze certain characteristics of an \\nindividual, including: \\n\\n•  Work performance \\n\\n•  Economic situation \\n\\n•  Health \\n\\n•  Personal preferences \\n\\n•  Interests \\n\\n•  Behaviour \\n\\nTraceability  \\nThe ability to trace the origin, path and transformations \\nof data through different systems and processes. \\nTraceability is necessary to ensure data quality, \\nreliability, security and comprehensibility. \\n\\nUniversal accessibility  \\nUniversal accessibility refers to the characteristic \\nof a product, process, service, information or \\nenvironment that, with equity and inclusiveness in \\nmind, enables all people, whatever their abilities, \\nto perform activities independently and achieve \\nequivalent results. Universal accessibility helps to \\nreduce situations of disability and exclusion.\\n\\n22\\n\\n\fWritten by the Service de la planification stratégique et de la performance organisationnelle and the Service \\ndes technologies de l’information.  \\n\\nIn collaboration with numerous members of the city administration, notably from the Service du greffe, the \\nService de la diversité et de l’inclusion sociale, the Bureau de la transition écologique et de la résilience, the \\nService de la culture, the Service de l’urbanisme et de la mobilité, and the Service du développement économique.  \\n\\nWe would like to acknowledge the contributions of the Montréal community and of Nicolas Merveille \\n(Université du Québec à Montréal), who led the interview process with community experts.

2022\\n\\n\fThis document constitutes the city’s official open data policy.\\n\\nRevision History\\n\\nVersion\\n\\nDate\\n\\nMain changes\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n2022-06\\n\\n•  Addition of a commitment concerning the protection of privacy and the \\n\\nmisuse of data.\\n\\n•  Addition of a commitment concerning the prioritization and \\noptimization of the usefulness of data for the community.\\n\\n•  Review of definitions and clarification of guidelines.\\n\\n•  Review of the responsibility of application of the policy, and removal of \\n\\nthe deadline in favour of publishing data on an ongoing basis.\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n2015-12\\n\\nFirst version of the policy.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\fIntroduction\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nData: Representation of a unit of information, \\ncoded in a format that enables its processing by a \\ncomputer. Data can be reused with software and \\nreinterpreted based on the context of its analysis.\\n\\nOpen data: Data made available free of charge to the \\npublic under an open licence. Open data is meant to \\nbe easily accessible and available in open format.\\n\\nOpen format: Data format whose technical \\nspecifications are public so that the data is accessible \\nwith no technical, legal or financial restrictions.\\n\\nOpen licence: A licence that permits access to  \\nand the use and distribution of data, with little or  \\nno restriction.\\n\\nDegree of openness: Authorized level of access for \\ndata held by the city. The degree of openness can \\ntake the following values:\\n\\n•  Open: The data is deemed public and freely \\n\\naccessible, and is thus subject to the regulations \\nherein and the conditions set out in the  \\nopen data licence.\\n\\n•  Restricted: Access to the data is restricted to \\n\\ncertain clearly identified administrative units or \\npartner organizations.\\n\\n•  Closed: Access to the data is limited to the \\n\\nadministrative unit responsible for it.\\n\\nMontréal’s municipal administration generates \\nand manages vast quantities of data through its \\nactivities. These data represent significant digital \\nassets for the city and its residents. With this policy, \\nthe city commits to freely sharing the data held in \\nits trust so that everyone can access it and benefit \\nfrom it. The publication of open data – an essential \\nvector for transparency in municipal government \\nand for citizen participation – generates multiple \\nopportunities to contribute to the common good. \\n\\nObjectives\\n\\nThe city adopted this policy to specify to its \\nadministrative units their duties relating to open \\ndata, and to explain to residents its commitments \\nconcerning access to and the use of municipal data. \\nThe policy specifies the guiding principles governing \\nopen data, along with the responsibilities associated \\nwith its application. \\n\\nOrganizational scope  \\nof the policy\\n\\nThis policy applies to all administrative units \\nat the city, including central departments and \\nboroughs, and to data related to activities that \\nfall under the jurisdiction of the agglomeration. \\nThe city recommends the adoption of this policy \\nby paramunicipal organizations and organizations \\nincluded in its reporting entity. It also invites its \\npartners and all stakeholders working on Montréal’s \\neconomic, social and territorial development to  \\ndo the same.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\fCommitments\\n1.  The city recognizes that open access to the data  \\nit produces and holds presents advantages in \\nterms of transparency in the public adminis-\\ntration, democratic and social life, economic \\ndevelopment, and organizational efficiency.\\n\\n2.  The city commits to publishing its data on its \\n\\nopen data Web site, gradually and continuously, \\nwhile taking into account the costs, efforts and \\nresources required for that purpose.\\n\\n3.  The city will prioritize the publication of data in \\norder to maximize their usefulness and impact \\nfor the broader Montréal community. Where \\npossible, priority placed on open data will be \\nestablished based on their potential to contribute \\nto the following elements:\\n\\n3.1.  Respond to the needs and requests of \\n\\nresidents.\\n\\n3.2.  Improve public knowledge of the city’s \\n\\nactivities and commitments.\\n\\n3.3.  Strengthen the city’s accountability and the \\n\\nimplementation of its strategic guidelines.\\n\\n3.4.  Facilitate collaboration and the creation  \\n\\nof new tools and knowledge.\\n\\n3.5.  Promote the city’s economic, social and \\n\\necological vitality.\\n\\n3.6.  Create opportunities for improving the \\n\\ndelivery of public services and the quality  \\nof life of residents.\\n\\nGuiding principles of data \\npublication\\n1.  Open by default: Any data collected or acquired \\nby the city is considered open unless there is \\njustification for restricting access to it.\\n\\n2.  The city publishes its data in compliance with \\n\\nthe applicable laws, notably the Act respecting \\naccess to documents held by public bodies and \\nthe protection of personal information.\\n\\n3.  The city shall undertake the means it deems \\n\\nreasonable to abide by principles of transparency \\nand quality, as inspired by the Sunlight \\nFoundation:\\n\\n3.1.  Exhaustive: Data published by the city must \\n\\nbe as complete as possible and reflect all \\nthat has been collated on a given subject.\\n\\n3.2.  Primary: Published data includes original \\n\\ndata collected and any available details \\nconcerning the manner in which the data \\nwere collected.\\n\\n3.3.  Timeliness: Data made available are \\n\\npublished or updated in a timely fashion.\\n\\n3.4.  Ease of access: The data published are \\n\\naccessible to the broadest possible range  \\nof users and for the widest possible variety  \\nof uses.\\n\\n3.5.  Machine readable: Data are readable \\nthrough computer processing and are \\nstructured to allow automated processing.\\n\\n3.6.  Non-discriminatory: Data are freely \\n\\naccessible to everyone, at any time, without \\nprior justification or identification. \\n\\n3.7.  Non-proprietary: Data are published in an \\nopen format and do not require a specific \\nsoftware to be used.\\n\\n3.8.  Copyright-free: Open data are not subject \\nto third-party copyrights, use of a patent, \\ntrademarks or trade secrets.\\n\\n3.9.  Permanent: Once published, data remain \\naccessible so as to promote the ability to \\naccess them over time, in accordance with \\nthe applicable data retention requirements.\\n\\n3.10.  Free of charge: Data are published as \\n\\ncollected, with no user fees.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\f4. The city commits to adopting the digital practices \\nand solutions required to facilitate data sharing \\ninternally and with the community, and to ensure \\ndata quality.\\n\\n5. The city commits to implementing automation \\nmechanisms to ensure that data is updated at \\nregular intervals.\\n\\n6. The city commits to implementing all the means \\nit deems necessary to protect the right to privacy \\nand prevent the misuse of open data.\\n\\n7. The city commits to establishing participation \\nmechanisms with Montréal residents and data \\nusers in an effort to take into account their needs \\nin relation to data publication processes.\\n\\n8. The city commits to collaborating with the open \\ndata community to help advance standards and \\npromote best practices, including compliance with \\nlocal and international standards.\\n\\nData inventory and \\nexceptions \\n\\n1. The city commits to publishing an inventory of \\ndata held in its trust, regardless of their degree \\nof openness, with the exception of data whose \\npublication raises a public safety issue.\\n\\n2. Justification must be provided for data that is not \\nopened. The following reasons represent relevant \\njustifications that must be documented for all data \\nconcerned:\\n\\n2.1  Respect for privacy and personal information.\\n\\n2.1.1  However, if data remains relevant once it is \\n  made anonymous, it should be published \\n\\nanonymously.\\n\\n2.2  Public safety and the safety of property.\\n\\n2.3  The city does not hold intellectual property \\n\\n  rights or the right to republish data.\\n\\n2.4  The protection of third-party industrial secrets.\\n\\n2.5  All applicable laws, regulations or legal  \\n\\nlimitations.\\n\\nResponsibilities concern-\\ning the application of  \\nthe policy\\n\\nAs Chief data owner, the Direction générale has \\nthe ultimate authority to decide on the degree of \\nopenness of data held in the city’s trust.\\n\\nEach administrative unit is responsible for \\nimplementing the provisions of this policy in its \\nactivities and for ensuring that the policy is applied \\nin accordance with the conditions specified in the \\nData Governance Directive.\\n\\nThe team responsible for coordinating open data \\npublication will ensure that the commitments set out \\nin this policy are fulfilled and that the data inventory \\nis updated, and it will oversee the open data \\nactivities undertaken by administrative units.\\n\\nSupporting documents\\n\\nThis policy draws on other relevant documents:\\n\\n•  The Data Governance Directive.

https://montreal.ca/en/topics/governance-personal-information 2025-08-22T15:10:06+00:00       en      21126       3206 Governance of personal information\\nThis directive establishes the governance of activities related to the management of personal information. It also identifies the measures to be implemented to fulfill the city’s responsibilities to its employees and to the public.\\nThe city recognizes the importance of respecting privacy and of safeguarding personal information held by either itself or a third party. Necessary steps are taken to comply with all requirements of the Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection of personal information (CQLR, ch. A-2.1).\\nScope\\nThis directive applies to all city employees who collect, use and retain personal information.\\nDefinitions\\nInformation asset: Any information, document, information or communication system or technology.\\nPersonal information: Any information concerning an individual that allows for their identification. Information is considered:\\n- Sensitive when, due to its nature, context of use or communication, it elicits a high degree of expectation of privacy\\n- Se-identified when it no longer allows the person concerned to be directly identified\\nPrivacy Impact Assessment (PIA): A preventive approach aimed at better protecting personal information and respecting the privacy of individuals.\\nConfidentiality incident: Sections 63.8 to 63.11 of the Act govern the management of confidentiality incidents by public bodies. The following events constitute incidents:\\n- Unauthorized access to personal information\\n- Unauthorized use of personal information\\n- Unauthorized release of personal information\\n- Loss of personal information or any other breach of the protection of such information\\nPersonal information - General principles\\nCollection of information\\nPersonal information is collected from the individual concerned upon obtaining their explicit, voluntary and informed consent, given for specific purposes.\\nThese criteria are defined as follows:\\n- Explicit: Consent must be obvious, certain and unequivocal, leaving no doubt about the expressed intent.\\n- Voluntary: Consent must be given without coercion.\\n- Informed: The request must be precise and thorough to enable the individual to give informed consent.\\n- Given for specific purposes: Consent must be requested for specific purposes, and the individual must be able to understand them in order to give consent.\\nThe city must collect only that personal information required for the exercise of its mandates or the implementation of a program under its purview.\\nCity employees must use personal information solely for the purposes for which it was collected and act with caution.\\nThe city does not disclose any personal or otherwise confidential information, except in certain exceptions specified in the Act.\\nAn individual providing personal information must be informed of:\\n- The purposes for which the information is required\\n- Whether the request is mandatory or optional\\n- The consequences of giving or refusing consent\\n- The right to access and correct information as stipulated in the Act\\n- The measures put in place to ensure the confidentiality of information during transmission\\n- The categories of individuals who will have access to this information; in the case where personal information is collected for a third party, the third party’s name and the personal information that will be communicated to them\\n- Where applicable, the names of third parties or categories of third parties (e.g., service providers) to whom it is necessary to communicate information for The enumerated purposes (see Communication of personal information to a third party, without the consent of the person concerned, in the context of a service or business mandate or contract)\\n- The possibility that information may be disclosed outside of Québec\\nIf the city collects personal information from the person concerned using technology containing features that make it possible to identify, locate or profile them, the individual must first be informed of:\\n- The use of such technology\\n- The methods available to activate these features\\nConfidentiality incidents\\nAny employee who discovers or suspects the existence of an incident must immediately fill out the Confidentiality incident reporting form and inform their manager. Submission of the form is mandatory, whether the risk of harm is presumed or not, and serious or not (Procedure C-OG-GREF-P-22-001).The city clerk’s office handles these incidents.\\nMinor person\\nPersonal information of an individual under 14 years of age cannot be collected without the consent of a person with parental authority or acting as a guardian, unless this collection is manifestly in the best interests of the minor. Consent of a person over 14 years of age can be given by the same individuals or by the minor themselves.\\nAccess to personal information, protection and right to correction\\nAn individual can request access to information concerning them and ask to have it corrected.\\nThey can also request:\\n- To withdraw their consent for the communication or use of personal information collected\\n- To destroy or withdraw personal information, depending on the circumstances; in some cases, the city may refuse a request for destruction or withdrawal, especially when personal information is required for compliance with the Act or with a contractual agreement between the parties, or in relation to a claim\\n- To suspend the processing of certain personal information, in particular to establish its accuracy or the reason for its processing\\n- To transfer certain personal information to another party\\nRequests for access or correction, or any questions related to this directive, should be addressed, in writing, to the person in charge of access to information, Emmanuel Tani-Moore at [email protected].\\nComplaints\\nA person who considers that their personal information has been handled inappropriately, or who believes that the Act has not been respected, may file a complaint with the city clerk’s office at [email protected].\\nThe complaint may relate to the collection, storage, use, communication or destruction of personal information.\\nIt will be processed confidentially. Personal information is protected, meaning it is accessible only to those people authorized to consult it in the performance of their duties.\\nComplaints can also be made in writing to the Commission d’accès à l’information - Direction de la surveillance.\\nAutomated processing of personal information\\nA decision based on automated processing is made without human intervention (e.g., an algorithm).\\nIn addition to the information provided during the collection of personal information, the city must inform the person concerned that this information is used to make a decision based on automated processing.\\nIt must also inform the person concerned:\\n- Of the personal information used to make the decision\\n- Of the reasons, major factors and parameters that led to the decision\\n- Of their right to correct the personal information used to make the decision\\n- That they can ask to have the decision reviewed by a natural person\\nCommunication to a third party without the consent of the person concerned\\nIn the context of a mandate or service or business contract, the city must enter into a written agreement that includes:\\n- The provisions of the Act that the other party undertakes to comply with\\n- Security measures to protect the confidentiality of the personal information communicated\\nThe other party may only use the information for the execution of its mandate or contract. The agreement should, therefore, prohibit the use of personal information for its own purposes or those of a third party.

    en      14753       2318 Confidentiality policy\\nThis confidentiality policy outlines Montréal’s (hereinafter called the “city”) practices with regard to protecting the confidentiality of personal information collected by technological means, such as a Web site, an application or a related object. By browsing our Web site, you recognize and accept these terms of use.\\nThe city recognizes the importance of respecting privacy and of protecting the personal information in its possession. It takes the necessary measures to comply with all requirements of the Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information (CQLR, ch. A-2.1).\\nThe confidentiality policy outlines the practices with regard to protecting the confidentiality of personal information collected by technological means, such as a Web site, an application or a related object.\\nThe city undertakes to inform any person concerned by a confidentiality incident involving personal information in its possession and presenting a risk of serious harm.\\nPersonal information\\nPersonal information is any information that relates to a physical person and that allows that person to be identified. It is confidential. Unless otherwise agreed, personal information may not be disclosed without the consent of the person concerned.\\nCollection of personal information\\nThe city may collect only that personal information which is required for the performance of its functions and for the delivery of services to the public.\\nConsent to the collection of personal information must be manifest, free, and enlightened, and must be given for specific purposes.\\nCity employees shall use personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and shall take appropriate precautions.\\nIf the city asks you to provide personal information, you will first be informed of the following:\\n- The intended use of the information\\n- The categories of employees who will have access to this information\\n- Whether the request is mandatory or optional\\n- The consequences of refusing the request\\n- The right to access and correct information as stipulated in the Act\\n- The measures put in place to ensure the confidentiality of information during transmission\\n- Where applicable, the name of the third party for whom the information is being collected, and the name of the third party collecting the information\\nIf you voluntarily transmit personal or confidential information to the city, whether by e-mail, non-secure electronic form or any other technological means, the city will use only the information needed to respond to your message or to follow up on your request.\\nNon-disclosure to third parties\\nThe city does not rent, sell or exchange personal information (name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) or financial information (credit card numbers) that could be used to identify you.\\nThe city undertakes not to disclose such personal information unless it is requested under a legal obligation or a court order or in the context of the execution of a contract entrusted to a third party. When the city retains the services of an external company, it employs all appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is protected in accordance with the Act and that it is collected, used, retained and destroyed in a manner that respects this policy.\\nData security\\nYour data may be stored outside the country. In this case, the city will do all it can to ensure a level of protection equivalent to that offered for data stored on Canadian soil and will ensure in particular that all applicable legal requirements are met, including those relating to the protection of data.\\nThe city applies high standards and uses strong security systems in the design, implementation and daily operation of the Platforms (Web sites and mobile applications) and the servers and networks underlying them. In addition, the city continues its efforts to detect and block intrusions into or aimed at its Platforms. The city has put in place various means to ensure that your personal information is protected against the risk of loss and theft, and the risks of unauthorized access, communication, reproduction, use, modification or destruction. These means include physical, administrative and technological security measures deemed reasonable given the degree of sensitivity, the quantity and the format of the personal information collected and the storage methods used.\\nHowever, no security measures are absolute or fully guaranteed. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with the city is no longer secure (for example, if you believe the security of the information you have provided has been compromised), contact us immediately at [email protected].\\nStorage\\nOnce the purposes for which the personal information was collected have been achieved, the information is destroyed or made anonymous, subject to the city’s storage rules and the Archives Act (CQLR, chapter A-21.1). However, the city reserves the right to retain, for a reasonable period of time, certain personal information in order to comply with the Act, prevent fraud, collect fees due, settle a claim or related issues, or cooperate with an investigation.\\nAccess to your personal information and right of correction\\nUnder the Act, a person may request access to information concerning them and may have it corrected.\\nA person also has the following rights:\\n- Withdraw consent at any time to the disclosure or use of personal information collected\\n- Request the deletion, destruction or removal of personal information under certain circumstances. There are some exceptions under which the city may refuse a deletion or destruction request, such as when the personal information is required to comply with the law or with a contractual agreement between the parties, or in relation to a claim\\n- Request the suspension of processing of certain personal information in particular to establish its accuracy or the reason for its processing\\n- Request the transfer of certain personal information to another party\\nRequests for access or correction, or any questions related to this policy, should be addressed, in writing, to the person in charge of access to information, Emmanuel Tani-Moore, at [email protected].\\nDigital services\\nThe city provides you with access to Platforms. You may have to provide personal information in order to use the digital services offered on the Platforms.\\nThis information is collected to:\\n- Spare you the need to identify yourself each time you request service\\n- Improve services\\n- Correctly respond to your questions, comments and suggestions\\nThe information required to create a user account is retained by the city and its partners.\\nAccess to the information will be restricted to personnel responsible for management of the Platforms or for delivery of the specific service requested.\\nYou have rights, as provided under the Act, of access and correction of personal information collected by technological means.\\nYou agree and understand that you are responsible for the security and confidentiality of the password associated with your account. Consequently, you agree to be solely responsible to the city for all activities that take place in this account. If you become aware of or reasonably suspect an intrusion of any kind, including any theft, loss, disclosure or unauthorized use of your login information, you must immediately notify us.\\nGeolocation\\nIn the event that the geolocation function is activated on your browser when using the Platforms, the city uses your location only to improve the ergonomics of the Platforms.\\nThe city does not track your movements when you use the Platforms. You may disable the geolocation feature on your device at any time, by consulting the manufacturer’s instructions. Deactivating geolocation may prevent you from accessing certain functionalities of the Platforms, however.\\nCookies\\nCookies are used to facilitate and optimize your navigation on the Platforms. Cookies are small text files that are downloaded and saved in the memory of the device you use to view Web pages. Cookies used by the city do not enable the collection of your personal information.\\nMost Web browsers accept cookies by default. You may change your browser’s security parameters at any time to block the use of cookies or erase those already stored on your device. This action does not prevent you from accessing the Platforms, but could have an impact on their performance during your visit.\\nStatistics\\nThe city uses Google Analytics analysis tools on its Platforms. These tools collect, analyze, measure and present data on visits to the Platforms, with the goal of understanding and optimizing Internet usage.\\nThe city retains this type of information to compile statistics about:\\n- The number of visitors\\n- The most frequently used pages\\n- The technology used by its Platforms’ clientele\\n- Referring Web sites\\n- Users’ countries of origin\\nData collected by Google Analytics are transmitted outside Canada to Google servers and may be processed in any countries where Google operates servers. These data may be subject to the legislation of such countries. For further information, refer to the Google Analytics Terms of Service.\\nLinks to other sites\\nThe Platforms contain hyperlinks that provide quick access to Web sites belonging to third parties and managed by them. The city puts these hyperlinks at the disposal of users of its Platforms for purposes of convenience and does not exercise any form of control over the content of the sites to which these hyperlinks lead.\\nWhen you click these hyperlinks, you are directed away from the city’s Web site, and the information exchanged is no longer subject to the city’s confidentiality policy, but to that of the Web site visited. The city makes no declaration, gives no approval and accepts no liability in respect of the content or use of such sites. The information presented on these sites may not be available in French or in English.\\nMobile application\\nYou acknowledge, consent and agree that the city can access, keep and disclose information and content in your account if required by law or if the city has bona fide reason to believe that protection or disclosure is necessary to:\\n- Comply with the legal process.\\n- Ensure compliance with the present Terms of Use.\\n- Respond to your customer service requests.\\n- Protect the rights, property or personal safety of the city, its users and the public.\\nVirtual assistant\\nWhen you use the virtual assistant, you acknowledge that:\\n- Answers are automatically generated by artificial intelligence from Montréal.ca content.

For special or complex situations, we invite you to call 311.\\nRequests submitted\\nBy submitting requests, you acknowledge and agree that:\\n- Your requests do not contain confidential or exclusive information.\\n- The city has no obligation to confidentiality with respect to requests, whether express or implicit.\\n- The city has the right to use or disclose (or not to use or disclose) requests for any reason whatsoever.\\n- Information in your request automatically becomes the property of the city, without any obligation on its behalf.\\n- Under no circumstances are you entitled to any type of refund or reimbursement whatsoever from the city.\\nFeedback tool\\nThe city uses an external application to collect your comments on the Montréal.ca site in order to improve its content and functionalities.\\nThis app collects only data about your device: model, IP address, browser type and version, and the language used.\\nMinors\\nNo function of the Platforms specifically seeks information from minors nor seeks to determine if the visitor is a minor. Personal information submitted on the Platforms by minors will be treated in the same manner as that submitted by adults.\\nThe city strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor in the use of the Internet by minors. Consequently, the city asks parents to guide their minor children when they are invited to provide personal information online. The city also requests that minors obtain the authorization of their parents before providing information online.\\nWeb browsing, HTTPS and encryption protocols\\nWhen you navigate the Web with your browser, it determines whether communications are adequately protected and displays a padlock symbol on the page to confirm that the communication session is secure. Caution: This does not apply to the mobile application.\\nThe city uses the most secure encryption protocols available on its Platforms. All confidential data travelling between your communication device and the city’s Platforms are protected by effective cryptographic means, thereby ensuring the confidentiality of your information.\\nProcessing complaints relating to the protection of personal information\\nA person who considers that their personal information has been handled inappropriately, or who believes that the Act has not been respected, may file a complaint.\\nThe complaint may relate to the collection, storage, use, communication or destruction of personal information.\\nIt will be processed confidentially. Personal information is protected, meaning it is accessible only to those people authorized to consult it in the performance of their duties.\\nComplaints must be submitted in writing to:\\nEmmanuel Tani-Moore, city clerk\\nCity clerk’s office\\n275 Rue Notre-Dame Est\\nMontréal, Québec\\nH2Y 1C6\\nComplaints can be addressed to [email protected] or sent in writing to the Commission d’accès à
